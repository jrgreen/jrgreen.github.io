  abstract = {We investigate a model for the dynamics of a solid object, which moves over a randomly vibrating solid surface and is subject to a constant external force. The dry friction between the two solids is modeled phenomenologically as being proportional to the sign of the object's velocity relative to the surface, and therefore shows a discontinuity at zero velocity. Using a path integral approach, we derive analytical expressions for the transition probability of the object's velocity and the stationary distribution of the work done on the object due to the external force. From the latter distribution, we also derive a fluctuation relation for the mechanical work fluctuations, which incorporates the effect of the dry friction.},

While a good understanding of the onset of chaos has been achieved, using as a mathematical tool the geometric theory of differentiable dynamical systems, moderately excited chaotic systems require new tools, which are provided by the ergodic theory of dynamical systems. This theory has reached a stage where fruitful contact and exchange with physical experiments has become widespread. The present review is an account of the main mathematical ideas and their concrete implementation in analyzing experiments. The main subjects are the theory of dimensions (number of excited degrees of freedom), entropy (production of information), and characteristic exponents (describing sensitivity to initial conditions). The relations between these quantities, as well as their experimental determination, are discussed. The systematic investigation of these quantities provides us for the first time with a reasonable understanding of dynamical systems, excited well beyond the quasiperiodic regimes. This is another step towards understanding highly turbulent fluids.},

Several analytical techniques-such as the Green function formalism and renormalization group methods-are also exposed. Care is devoted to the problem of sample to sample fluctuations, particularly acute here. We consider the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion, and discuss the generalizations of Einstein's relation in the presence of disorder. An effort is made to illustrate the theoretical models by describing many physical situations where anomalous diffusion laws have been-or could be-observed.},

This expression relates the escape rate to the difference between the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy for the fractal set of phase-space trajectories that are trapped forever in the finite region. This relation is well known for systems of a few degrees of freedom and is extended here to systems with many degrees of freedom. The formalism is applied to smooth hyperbolic systems, to cellular-automata lattice gases, and to hard-sphere systems. In the last case, the geometric constructions of Sinai and co-workers [Russ. Math. Surv. 25, 137 (1970); 42, 181 (1987)] for billiard systems are used to describe the relevant chaotic scattering phenomena. Some applications of this formalism to nonhyperbolic systems are also discussed.},

Advances in statistical mechanics (the fundamental formulations of Gibbs and Boltzmann, integral equations and perturbation theories, computer simulations), in knowledge of intermolecular forces, and in experimental techniques; have all contributed to this. Thirty years ago the very existence of liquids seemed a little mysterious; today one can make fairly precise predictions of the solid-liquid-gas phase diagram and of the microscopic and macroscopic static and dynamic properties of liquids. This paper is a survey, with particular emphasis on equilibrium properties, of the theory which underlies that basic understanding, which is now at least comparable with our understanding of the physics of solids.},

  abstract = {We inquire whether the connection between entropy production and phase space volume contraction rate reported recently for a class of thermostatted systems is an intrinsic property of a wide class of dynamical systems, or the result of the particular algorithm devised for thermostatting a system of interacting particles obeying, in the presence of nonequilibrium constraints, a time-reversible, dissipative dynamics. A nonequilibrium thermodynamics based on the balance equation for information entropy is developed for dissipative dynamical systems subjected, in addition, to a stochastic forcing. This latter accounts for the thermodynamic fluctuations accompanying the reduced description of the thermostat by a dissipative perturbation, for the interaction between the system and the external reservoirs or for perturbations of external origin. Entropy flux and entropy productionlike terms depending on the characteristics of the dynamics in phase space, particularly the rate of phase space volume contraction, are identified. Their connections with irreversible thermodynamics are explored. In particular, for thermostatted systems we find, without invoking an ad hoc conservation law between the system and the reservoir, that information entropy production is related to the opposite of the rate of phase space volume contraction to the second order in the distance from equilibrium.},

The ({$\varepsilon$}, {$\tau$})-entropy is the amount of information generated per unit time, at different scales {$\tau$} of time and {$\varepsilon$} of the observables. This quantity generalizes the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy per unit time from deterministic chaotic processes, to stochastic processes such as fluctuations in mesoscopic physico-chemical phenomena or strong turbulence in macroscopic spacetime dynamics. The random processes that are characterized include chaotic systems, Bernoulli and Markov chains, Poisson and birth-and-death processes, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Yaglom noises, fractional Brownian motions, different regimes of hydrodynamical turbulence, and the Lorentz-Boltzmann process of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. We also extend the ({$\varepsilon$}, {$\tau$})-entropy to spacetime processes like cellular automata, Conway's game of life, lattice gas automata, coupled maps, spacetime chaos in partial differential equations, as well as the ideal, the Lorentz, and the hard sphere gases. Through these examples it is demonstrated that the ({$\varepsilon$}, {$\tau$})-entropy provides a unified quantitative measure of dynamical randomness to both chaos and noises, and a method to detect transitions between dynamical states of different degrees of randomness as a parameter of the system is varied.},

  abstract = {The theory of large deviations has been applied successfully in the last 30 years or so to study the properties of equilibrium systems and to put the foundations of equilibrium statistical mechanics on a clearer and more rigorous footing. A similar approach has been followed more recently for nonequilibrium systems, especially in the context of interacting particle systems. We review here the basis of this approach, emphasizing the similarities and differences that exist between the application of large deviation theory for studying equilibrium systems on the one hand and nonequilibrium systems on the other. Of particular importance are the notions of macroscopic, hydrodynamic, and long-time limits, which are analogues of the equilibrium thermodynamic limit, and the notion of statistical ensembles which can be generalized to nonequilibrium systems. For the purpose of illustrating our discussion, we focus on applications to Markov processes, in particular to simple random walks.},

  abstract = {This paper is a review of results which have been recently obtained by applying mathematical concepts drawn, in particular, from differential geometry and topology, to the physics of Hamiltonian dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom of interest for statistical mechanics. The first part of the paper concerns the applications of methods used in classical differential geometry to study the chaotic dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Starting from the identity between the trajectories of a dynamical system and the geodesics in its configuration space, a geometric theory of chaotic dynamics can be developed, which sheds new light on the origin of chaos in Hamiltonian systems. In fact, it appears that chaos can be induced not only by negative curvatures, as was originally surmised, but also by positive curvatures, provided the curvatures are fluctuating along the geodesics. In the case of a system with a large number of degrees of freedom it is possible to give an analytical estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent by means of a geometric model independent of the dynamics. In the second part of the paper the phenomenon of phase transitions is addressed and it is here that topology comes into play. In fact, when a system undergoes a phase transition, the fluctuations of the configuration-space curvature exhibit a singular behavior at the phase transition point, which can be qualitatively reproduced using geometric models. In these models the origin of the singular behavior of the curvature fluctuations appears to be caused by a topological transition in configuration space. This leads us to put forward a Topological Hypothesis (TH). The content of the TH is that phase transitions would be related at a deeper level to a change in the topology of the configuration space of the system.},

  abstract = {Passive molecular movements in cells are often claimed to exhibit "anomalous subdiffusion", where the mean-squared displacement (MSD) scales as a power law of time with exponent \${\textbackslash}alpha{$<$} 1\$. Diffusion hindrance by obstacles is often invoked to explain these observations. In many studies of hindered diffusion, the estimated values of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ vary strongly. This led to the hypothesis that \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ depends on obstacle density. This is however at odds with the theoretical support for hindered diffusion among randomly located immobile obstacles, which predicts that true subdiffusion occurs only in the vicinity of the threshold for the percolation of obstacles, and that \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ takes a \{{\textbackslash}it unique\}, universal value. Here, we present refined simulations of hindered diffusion with biologically realistic parameters and bring forth four main contributions. (\{{\textbackslash}it i\}) We confirm that diffusion hindered by randomly located immobile obstacles does not exhibit variations of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and (\{{\textbackslash}it ii\}) that the MSD in fact never scales like a power law of time. (\{{\textbackslash}it iii\}) In contrast to diffusing obstacles, obstacles fluctuating around equilibrium positions preserve and even emphasize anomalous regimes. (\{{\textbackslash}it iv\}) Hindered diffusion is not equivalent to anomalous diffusion due to random traps with heavy-tailed trap time distribution. These results shed new light on the existing literature about subdiffusion.},

The theory has applications in many different scientific fields, ranging from queuing theory to statistics and from finance to engineering. It is also increasingly used in statistical physics for studying both equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. In this context, deep analogies can be made between familiar concepts of statistical physics, such as the entropy and the free energy, and concepts of large deviation theory having more technical names, such as the rate function and the scaled cumulant generating function. The first part of these notes introduces the basic elements of large deviation theory at a level appropriate for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics, engineering, chemistry, and mathematics. The focus there is on the simple but powerful ideas behind large deviation theory, stated in non-technical terms, and on the application of these ideas in simple stochastic processes, such as sums of independent and identically distributed random variables and Markov processes. Some physical applications of these processes are covered in exercises contained at the end of each section. In the second part, the problem of numerically evaluating large deviation probabilities is treated at a basic level. The fundamental idea of importance sampling is introduced there together with its sister idea, the exponential change of measure. Other numerical methods based on sample means and generating functions, with applications to Markov processes, are also covered.},

A thermodynamics formally identical to that in an ES can be formulated, but with definitions of work and heat as those needed to maintain the NESS. In this approach, the heat plays a crucial role and is directly related to the different behavior of a system?s forward and backward paths in time in an appropriate function space. However, an ambiguity in the choice of the time- backward path corresponding to a given time-forward path prevents a unique general formal theory for systems in a NESS. Unique unambiguous physically acceptable physical results for a system in a NESS appear to be obtainable only after specifying the physical nonequilibrium parameters, which define a system in a NESS as part of a larger system. NESS systems are therefore fundamentally different from those in an ES. Furthermore, an example is given for a particular system that the fluctuations of a system in a NESS behave in many respects very differently from those in a system in an ES.},

  abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

For conservative systems in thermal equilibrium the chaotic hypothesis implies the ergodic hypothesis. We outline a procedure to obtain the distribution \${\textbackslash}m\$: it leads to a new unifying point of view for the phase space behavior of dissipative and conservative systems. The chaotic hypothesis is confirmed in a non trivial, parameter--free, way by a recent computer experiment on the entropy production fluctuations in a shearing fluid far from equilibrium.

  abstract = {The master equation approach to Lyapunov spectra for many-particle systems is applied to nonequilibrium thermostated systems to discuss the conjugate pairing rule. We consider iso-kinetic thermostated systems with a shear flow sustained by an external restriction, in which particle interactions are expressed as a Gaussian white randomness. Positive Lyapunov exponents are calculated by using the Fokker-Planck equation to describe the tangent vector dynamics. We introduce another Fokker-Planck equation to describe the time-reversed tangent vector dynamics, which leads to the calculation of the negative Lyapunov exponents. Using the Lyapunov exponents provided by these two Fokker-Planck equations we show the conjugate pairing rule is satisfied for thermostated systems with a shear flow in the thermodynamic limit which allow us to replace the friction coefficient with a constant number. We also give an explicit form to connect the Lyapunov exponents with the time correlation of the interaction matrix in a thermostated system with a color field.},

  abstract = {Recent work on many-particle systems reveals the existence of regular collective perturbations corresponding to the smallest positive Lyapunov exponents (LEs), called hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes. Until now, however, these modes have been found only for hard-core systems. Here we report results on Lyapunov spectra and Lyapunov vectors (LVs) for Lennard-Jones fluids. By considering the Fourier transform of the coordinate fluctuation density u({$\alpha$})(x,t), it is found that the LVs with {$\lambda\approx$}0 are highly dominated by a few components with low wave numbers. These numerical results provide strong evidence that hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes do exist in soft-potential systems, although the collective Lyapunov modes are more vague than in hard-core systems. In studying the density and temperature dependence of these modes, it is found that, when the value of the Lyapunov exponent {$\lambda$}({$\alpha$}) is plotted as function of the dominant wave number kmax of the corresponding LV, all data from simulations with different densities and temperatures collapse onto a single curve. This shows that the dispersion relation {$\lambda$}({$\alpha$}) vs kmax for hydrodynamical Lyapunov modes appears to be universal for the low-density cases studied here. Despite the wavelike character of the LVs, no steplike structure exists in the Lyapunov spectrum of the systems studied here, in contrast to the hard-core case. Further numerical simulations show that the finite-time LEs fluctuate strongly. We have also investigated localization features of LVs and propose a length scale to characterize the Hamiltonian spatiotemporal chaotic states.},

  abstract = {The stability analysis introduced by Lyapunov and extended by Oseledec provides an excellent tool to describe the character of nonlinear n-dimensional flows by n global exponents if these flows are stationary in time. However, here we discuss two shortcomings: (a) the local exponents fail to indicate the origin of instability where trajectories start to diverge. Instead, their time evolution contains a much stronger chaos than the trajectories, which is only eliminated by integrating over a long time. Therefore, shorter time intervals cannot be characterized correctly, which would be essential to analyse changes of chaotic character as in transients. (b) Although Oseledec uses an n dimensional sphere around a point x to be transformed into an n dimensional ellipse in first order, this local ellipse has not yet been evaluated. The aim of this contribution is to eliminate these two shortcomings. Problem (a) disappears if the Oseledec method is replaced by a frame with a `constraint' as performed by Rateitschak and Klages (RK) [Rateitschak K, Klages R, Lyapunov instability for a periodic Lorentz gas thermostated by deterministic scattering. Phys Rev E 2002;65:036209/1--11]. The reasons why this method is better will be illustrated by comparing different systems. In order to analyze shorter time intervals, integrals between consecutive Poincar{\'e} points will be evaluated. The local problem (b) will be solved analytically by introducing the `symmetric Jacobian for local Lyapunov exponents' and its orthogonal submatrix, which enable to search in the full phase space for extreme local separation exponents. These are close to the RK exponents but need no time integration of the RK frame. Finally, four sets of local exponents are compared: Oseledec frame, RK frame, symmetric Jacobian for local Lyapunov exponents and its orthogonal submatrix.},

It is then possible to understand why nonequilibrium steady states must obey the Second Law of Thermodynamics, not just with high probability, but with probability one. This is because nonequilibrium states are so rare, relative to equilibrium ones, as to occupy a zero-volume multifractal part of equilibrium phase space. These conclusions are generally valid. We illustrate them here by studying equilibrium manybody systems, both solid and fluid, as well as a simple one-body chaotic nonequilibrium steady state. In all these cases we follow the motion of an orthonormal set of comoving vectors {$\delta$}, determining the time-averaged ``Lyapunov Spectrum'' of dynamic instability rates, as well as the vectors ``Rotation Spectrum'', and relating these spectra to the irreversible nature of nonequilibrium flows described above.},

Special emphasis is placed on the finitely extendable nonlinear elastic (FENE) chain models which account for molecular stretch, bending, and topology. More coarse-grained descriptions such as primitive path models, and elongated particle models are reviewed as well. We focus on their inherently anisotropic material---in particular rheological---properties via deterministic and stochastic approaches. A number of representative examples are given on how simple (often high-dimensional) models can, and have been implemented in order to enable the analysis of the microscopic origins of the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of polymeric materials. These examples are shown to provide us with a number of routes for developing and establishing coarse-grained (low-dimensional) models devoted to the prediction of a reduced number of significant material properties. At this stage approximations which allow for an analytical treatment are discussed as well. Concerning the types of complex fluids, we cover the range from flexible to semiflexible polymers in melts and solutions, wormlike micelles, structural suspensions including ferrofluids in field-induced anisotropic or liquid crystalline phases.},

  abstract = {Many macroscopic dynamical phenomena, for example in hydrodynamics and oscillatory chemical reactions, have been observed to display erratic or random time evolution, in spite of the deterministic character of their dynamics---a phenomenon known as macroscopic chaos1, 2, 3, 4, 5. On the other hand, it has been long supposed that the existence of chaotic behaviour in the microscopic motions of atoms and molecules in fluids or solids is responsible for their equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties. But this hypothesis of microscopic chaos has never been verified experimentally. Chaotic behaviour of a system is characterized by the existence of positive Lyapunov exponents, which determine the rate of exponential separation of very close trajectories in the phase space of the system6. Positive Lyapunov exponents indicate that the microscopic dynamics of the system are very sensitive to its initial state, which, in turn, indicates that the dynamics are chaotic; a small change in initial conditions will lead to a large change in the microscopic motion. Here we report direct experimental evidence for microscopic chaos in fluid systems, obtained by the observation of brownian motion of a colloidal particle suspended in water. We find a positive lower bound on the sum of positive Lyapunov exponents of the system composed of the brownian particle and the surrounding fluid.},

Numerically sampling such large deviations using the Lyapunov Weighted Dynamics allows one to pinpoint, for example, stable configurations in celestial mechanics or collections of interacting chaotic `breathers' in nonlinear media. Furthermore, we show that this numerical method allows one to compute the topological pressure of extended dynamical systems, a central quantity in the Thermodynamic of Trajectories of Ruelle.},

Simulating them in an efficient, accelerated way, is in fact quite simple. In this paper we review a computational technique to study such rare events in both stochastic and Hamiltonian systems.

Here, we examine their roles in dynamics; specifically, in the degree of deterministic chaos using the Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy rate and the spectra of Lyapunov exponents. With computer simulations of three-dimensional Lennard-Jones and Weeks-Chandler-Andersen fluids, we find repulsive forces dictate these dynamical properties, with attractive forces reducing the KS entropy at a given thermodynamic state. Regardless of interparticle forces, the maximal Lyapunov exponent is intensive for systems ranging from 200 to 2000 particles. Our finite-size scaling analysis also shows that the KS entropy is both extensive (a linear function of system-size) and additive. Both temperature and density control the ``dynamical chemical potential,'' the rate of linear growth of the KS entropy with system size. At fixed system-size, both the KS entropy and the largest exponent exhibit a maximum as a function of density. We attribute the maxima to the competition between two effects: as particles are forced to be in closer proximity, there is an enhancement from the sharp curvature of the repulsive potential and a suppression from the diminishing free volume and particle mobility. The extensivity and additivity of the KS entropy and the intensivity of the largest Lyapunov exponent, however, hold over a range of temperatures and densities across the liquid and liquid-vapor coexistence regimes.},

Here, we address this question and report complex behaviour of tens to thousands of colloidal nanoparticles in a system designed to be as plain as possible: the system is driven far from equilibrium by ultrafast laser pulses that create spatiotemporal temperature gradients, inducing Marangoni flow that drags particles towards aggregation; strong Brownian motion, used as source of fluctuations, opposes aggregation. Nonlinear feedback mechanisms naturally arise between flow, aggregate and Brownian motion, allowing fast external control with minimal intervention. Consequently, complex behaviour, analogous to those seen in living organisms, emerges, whereby aggregates can self-sustain, self-regulate, self-replicate, self-heal and can be transferred from one location to another, all within seconds. Aggregates can comprise only one pattern or bifurcated patterns can coexist, compete, endure or perish.},

  abstract = {Entropy production is a key quantity in any finite-time thermodynamic process. It is intimately tied with the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, embodying a tool to extend thermodynamic considerations all the way to non-equilibrium processes. It is also often used in attempts to provide the quantitative characterization of logical and thermodynamic irreversibility, stemming from processes in physics, chemistry and biology. Notwithstanding its fundamental character, a unifying theory of entropy production valid for general processes, both classical and quantum, has not yet been formulated. Developments pivoting around the frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, open quantum systems, and quantum information theory have led to substantial progress in such endeavour. This has culminated in the unlocking of a new generation of experiments able to address stochastic thermodynamic processes and the impact of entropy production on them. This paper aims to provide a compendium on the current framework for the description, assessment and manipulation of entropy production. We present both formal aspects of its formulation and the implications stemming from the potential quantum nature of a given process, including a detailed survey of recent experiments.},

In the microscopic regime, fluctuations prevent us from discerning the direction of time's arrow with certainty. Here, we find that a machine learning algorithm that is trained to infer the direction of time's arrow identifies entropy production as the relevant physical quantity in its decision-making process. Effectively, the algorithm rediscovers the fluctuation theorem as the underlying thermodynamic principle. Our results indicate that machine learning techniques can be used to study systems that are out of equilibrium, and ultimately to answer open questions and uncover physical principles in thermodynamics.},

One of the first efforts to use physical theory to study the functioning of machines was undertaken by the French engineer Sadi Carnot. Motivated by the concern of the French about the superiority of British steam engines, he undertook a systematic study of the physical processes governing steam engines, resulting in his remarkable paper Reflexions sur la puissance motrice du feu (On the Motive Power of Heat) published in 1826. Among the earliest successes of this new science, thermodynamics, was the formulation of criteria describing how well real processes perform in comparison with an ideal model. Carnot showed that any engine, using heat from a hot reservoir at temperature Th to do work, has to transfer some heat to a reservoir at lower temperature T1, and that no engine could convert into work more of the heat taken in at Th than the fraction {$\eta$}C = 1-(T1/Th) known as the Carnot efficiency.},

Fisher to his idea of statistical distance which has since been developed into Riemannian geometries on the space of statistical ensembles. Parallel to, though independently, of this progress, Riemannian geometries were being proposed on spaces of quantum states and also of thermodynamic states. Riemannian geometries in various fields have found various applications as different as population dynamics and fractional distillation, just to mention the first and the most recent ones. For decades, however, little attention was paid to the common theoretical basis of these geometric methods.This chapter intends to fill the gap. We present an elementary introduction to the concept and mathematics of statistical distance in order to help understand the emergence of Riemannian geometrical structures. While we put more emphasis on the thermodynamical aspects, the main goal is still the interpretation of different applications on equal footing and using a unified framework.},

However, although it is recognized that materials datasets are typically smaller and sometimes more diverse compared to other fields, the influence of availability of materials data on training machine learning models has not yet been studied, which prevents the possibility to establish accurate predictive rules using small materials datasets. Here we analyzed the fundamental interplay between the availability of materials data and the predictive capability of machine learning models. Instead of affecting the model precision directly, the effect of data size is mediated by the degree of freedom (DoF) of model, resulting in the phenomenon of association between precision and DoF. The appearance of precision--DoF association signals the issue of underfitting and is characterized by large bias of prediction, which consequently restricts the accurate prediction in unknown domains. We proposed to incorporate the crude estimation of property in the feature space to establish ML models using small sized materials data, which increases the accuracy of prediction without the cost of higher DoF. In three case studies of predicting the band gap of binary semiconductors, lattice thermal conductivity, and elastic properties of zeolites, the integration of crude estimation effectively boosted the predictive capability of machine learning models to state-of-art levels, demonstrating the generality of the proposed strategy to construct accurate machine learning models using small materials dataset.},

We review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can be applied to improve the rational design process and related examples of applications.

Traditional experiments and computational modelling often consume tremendous time and resources and are limited by their experimental conditions and theoretical foundations. Thus, it is imperative to develop a new method of accelerating the discovery and design process for novel materials. Recently, materials discovery and design using machine learning have been receiving increasing attention and have achieved great improvements in both time efficiency and prediction accuracy. In this review, we first outline the typical mode of and basic procedures for applying machine learning in materials science, and we classify and compare the main algorithms. Then, the current research status is reviewed with regard to applications of machine learning in material property prediction, in new materials discovery and for other purposes. Finally, we discuss problems related to machine learning in materials science, propose possible solutions, and forecast potential directions of future research. By directly combining computational studies with experiments, we hope to provide insight into the parameters that affect the properties of materials, thereby enabling more efficient and target-oriented research on materials discovery and design.},

The differences that exist between various kinds of experimental and calculated data require careful choices of data processing and machine learning methods. Here, we outline potential pitfalls involved in using machine learning without robust protocols. We address some problems of overfitting to training data using decision trees as an example, rational descriptor selection in the field of perovskites, and preserving physical interpretability in the application of dimensionality reducing techniques such as principal component analysis. We show how proceeding without the guidance of domain knowledge can lead to both quantitatively and qualitatively incorrect predictive models.},

Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python Jupyter notebooks to introduce modern ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton--proton collisions).

In this Review, we discuss recent progress in creating synthetic material systems capable of four such functions--keeping time, powering motion, building structures, and making copies. Chemical oscillators coordinate the temporal activity of material assemblies; molecular motors and active colloids convert chemical energy into mechanical forces and motions; chemical activation of self-assembling components provides temporal control over dissipative structures; information-rich nanomaterials replicate their structures in exponential fashion. These and other dynamic functions cannot be achieved at thermodynamic equilibrium but instead require flows of energy and matter to create and maintain spatiotemporal order. Such systems are captured within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, which describes the fluctuating thermodynamic quantities of driven systems. Even far from equilibrium, these quantities obey universal relations, which establish fundamental trade-offs between the rate of energy dissipation and performance metrics such as precision, efficiency, and speed. For each function considered, we present a simple kinetic model that offers general insights that inform the design and creation of dissipative material systems capable of dynamic functions. Overall, we aim to bridge experimental efforts in active soft matter and theoretical advances from stochastic thermodynamics to inform future research on material systems inspired by living matter.},

  abstract = {In many scientific fields, empirical models are employed to facilitate computational simulations of engineering systems. For example, in fluid mechanics, empirical Reynolds stress closures enable computationally-efficient Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations. Likewise, in solid mechanics, constitutive relations between the stress and strain in a material are required in deformation analysis. Traditional methods for developing and tuning empirical models usually combine physical intuition with simple regression techniques on limited data sets. The rise of high performance computing has led to a growing availability of high fidelity simulation data. These data open up the possibility of using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests or neural networks, to develop more accurate and general empirical models. A key question when using data-driven algorithms to develop these empirical models is how domain knowledge should be incorporated into the machine learning process. This paper will specifically address physical systems that possess symmetry or invariance properties. Two different methods for teaching a machine learning model an invariance property are compared. In the first method, a basis of invariant inputs is constructed, and the machine learning model is trained upon this basis, thereby embedding the invariance into the model. In the second method, the algorithm is trained on multiple transformations of the raw input data until the model learns invariance to that transformation. Results are discussed for two case studies: one in turbulence modeling and one in crystal elasticity. It is shown that in both cases embedding the invariance property into the input features yields higher performance at significantly reduced computational training costs.},

However, although ML models are usually good at interpolating data, they often do not offer reliable extrapolations and can violate the laws of physics. Here, to address the limitations of traditional ML, we introduce a ``topology-informed ML'' paradigm---wherein some features of the network topology (rather than traditional descriptors) are used as fingerprint for ML models---and apply this method to predict the forward (stage I) dissolution rate of a series of silicate glasses. We demonstrate that relying on a topological description of the atomic network (i) increases the accuracy of the predictions, (ii) enhances the simplicity and interpretability of the predictive models, (iii) reduces the need for large training sets, and (iv) improves the ability of the models to extrapolate predictions far from their training sets. As such, topology-informed ML can overcome the limitations facing traditional ML (e.g., accuracy vs. simplicity tradeoff) and offers a promising route to predict the properties of materials in a robust fashion.},

Simulations and experiments are used to demonstrate that topological defects can be generated at will, and then constrained to move along specified trajectories, by inducing local stresses in an otherwise passive material. These results provide a foundation for design of autonomous and reconfigurable microfluidic systems where transport is controlled by modulating activity with light.},

We demonstrate the use of two different control fields, (i) applied vorticity and (ii) activity strength, to shape the dynamics of an extensile active nematic that is confined to a disk. In the absence of control inputs, the system exhibits two attractors, clockwise and counterclockwise circulating states characterized by two co-rotating topological +12 defects. We specifically seek spatiotemporal inputs that switch the system from one attractor to the other; we also examine phase-shifting perturbations. We identify control inputs by optimizing a penalty functional with three contributions: total control effort, spatial gradients in the control, and deviations from the desired trajectory. This work demonstrates that optimal control theory can be used to calculate nontrivial inputs capable of restructuring active nematics in a manner that is economical, smooth, and rapid, and therefore will serve as a guide to experimental efforts to control active matter.},

Traditional methods for predicting the dynamics of active nematics rely on hydrodynamic models, which accurately describe idealized flows and many of the steady-state properties, but do not capture certain detailed dynamics of experimental active nematics. We have developed a deep learning approach that uses a Convolutional Long-Short-Term-Memory (ConvLSTM) algorithm to automatically learn and forecast the dynamics of active nematics. We demonstrate our purely data-driven approach on experiments of 2D unconfined active nematics of extensile microtubule bundles, as well as on data from numerical simulations of active nematics.},

In nanoscale colloidal systems, however, less is known about the physical rules governing their spatial organization, i.e., self-assembly, into functional materials. Here, we monitor real-time self-assembly dynamics at the single nanoparticle level, which reveal marked similarities to foundational principles of polymerization. Specifically, using the prototypical system of gold triangular nanoprisms, we show that colloidal self-assembly is analogous to polymerization in three aspects: ensemble growth statistics following models for step-growth polymerization, with nanoparticles as linkable ``monomers''; bond angles determined by directional internanoparticle interactions; and product topology determined by the valency of monomeric units. Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy imaging and theoretical modeling elucidate the nanometer-scale mechanisms for these polymer-like phenomena in nanoparticle systems. The results establish a quantitative conceptual framework for self-assembly dynamics that can aid in designing future nanoparticle-based materials.},

Analogously, but in a purely computational realm, machine learning algorithms estimate models to capture predictable structure and identify irrelevant noise in training data. This happens through optimization of performance metrics, such as model likelihood. If physically implemented, is there a sense in which computational models estimated through machine learning are physically preferred? We introduce the thermodynamic principle that work production is the most relevant performance metric for an adaptive physical agent and compare the results to the maximum-likelihood principle that guides machine learning. Within the class of physical agents that most efficiently harvest energy from their environment, we demonstrate that an efficient agent's model explicitly determines its architecture and how much useful work it harvests from the environment. We then show that selecting the maximum-work agent for given environmental data corresponds to finding the maximum-likelihood model. This establishes an equivalence between nonequilibrium thermodynamics and dynamic learning. In this way, work maximization emerges as an organizing principle that underlies learning in adaptive thermodynamic systems.},

While several measures have been proposed for this task, none have universal applicability and ease of use. In this article, we suggest a set of requirements for a well-behaved measure of process distinguishability. Moreover, we propose a family of measures, called divergence rates, that satisfy all of these requirements. Focusing on a particular member of this family---the coemission divergence rate---we show that it can be computed efficiently, behaves qualitatively similar to other commonly used measures in their regimes of applicability, and remains well behaved in scenarios where other measures break down.},

  abstract = {The problem of retrosynthetic planning can be framed as a one-player game, in which the chemist (or a computer program) works backward from a molecular target to simpler starting materials through a series of choices regarding which reactions to perform. This game is challenging as the combinatorial space of possible choices is astronomical, and the value of each choice remains uncertain until the synthesis plan is completed and its cost evaluated. Here, we address this search problem using deep reinforcement learning to identify policies that make (near) optimal reaction choices during each step of retrosynthetic planning according to a user-defined cost metric. Using a simulated experience, we train a neural network to estimate the expected synthesis cost or value of any given molecule based on a representation of its molecular structure. We show that learned policies based on this value network can outperform a heuristic approach that favors symmetric disconnections when synthesizing unfamiliar molecules from available starting materials using the fewest number of reactions. We discuss how the learned policies described here can be incorporated into existing synthesis planning tools and how they can be adapted to changes in the synthesis cost objective or material availability.},

Materials discovery is frustratingly slow, with the large time and resource cost often providing only small gains in property performance. Furthermore, researchers are unwilling to take large risks that they will only know the outcome of months or years later. Computation is playing an increasing role in allowing rapid screening of large numbers of materials from vast search space to identify promising candidates for laboratory synthesis and testing. However, there is a problem, in that many materials computationally predicted to have encouraging properties cannot be readily realised in the lab. This minireview looks at how we can tackle the problem of confirming that hypothetical materials are synthetically realisable, through consideration of all the stages of the materials discovery process, from obtaining the components, reacting them to a material in the correct structure, through to processing into a desired form. In an ideal world, a material prediction would come with an associated `recipe' for the successful laboratory preparation of the material. We discuss the opportunity to thus prevent wasted effort in experimental discovery programmes, including those using automation, to accelerate the discovery of novel materials.},

We study 36 different conditions for a single block copolymer, exploring three parameters: polymer concentration, temperature and rate addition of selective solvent. The data shows that polymer concentration plays an important role in determining which morphologies are accessible within a given set of experimental parameters and provides evidence that vesicles can evolve into particles with complex internal structures, supportive of recent mechanistic studies. Most importantly, the data shows a complex relationship between all parameters and the resulting kinetically trapped morphologies indicating that combined in situ and ex situ studies are required to gain a fundamental understanding of kinetically controlled block copolymer assembly processes.},

These approaches lead to surrogate machine learning models that enable rapid predictions based purely on past data rather than by direct experimentation or by computations/simulations in which fundamental equations are explicitly solved. Data-centric informatics methods are becoming useful to determine material properties that are hard to measure or compute using traditional methods---due to the cost, time or effort involved---but for which reliable data either already exists or can be generated for at least a subset of the critical cases. Predictions are typically interpolative, involving fingerprinting a material numerically first, and then following a mapping (established via a learning algorithm) between the fingerprint and the property of interest. Fingerprints, also referred to as ``descriptors'', may be of many types and scales, as dictated by the application domain and needs. Predictions may also be extrapolative---extending into new materials spaces---provided prediction uncertainties are properly taken into account. This article attempts to provide an overview of some of the recent successful data-driven ``materials informatics'' strategies undertaken in the last decade, with particular emphasis on the fingerprint or descriptor choices.

Here we describe how amphiphilic self-assembly can be preceded by liquid--liquid phase separation. The assembly of a model block co-polymer system into vesicular structures was probed through a combination of liquid-phase electron microscopy, self-consistent field computations and Gibbs free energy calculations. This analysis shows the formation of polymer-rich liquid droplets that act as a precursor in the bottom-up formation of spherical micelles, which then evolve into vesicles. The liquid--liquid phase separation plays a role in determining the resulting vesicles' structural properties, such as their size and membrane thickness, and the onset of kinetic traps during self-assembly.},

  abstract = {Amphiphilic small molecules and polymers form commonplace nanoscale macromolecular compartments and bilayers, and as such are truly essential components in all cells and in many cellular processes. The nature of these architectures, including their formation, phase changes, and stimuli-response behaviors, is necessary for the most basic functions of life, and over the past half-century, these natural micellar structures have inspired a vast diversity of industrial products, from biomedicines to detergents, lubricants, and coatings. The importance of these materials and their ubiquity have made them the subject of intense investigation regarding their nanoscale dynamics with increasing interest in obtaining sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to directly observe nanoscale processes. However, the vast majority of experimental methods involve either bulk-averaging techniques including light, neutron, and X-ray scattering, or are static in nature including even the most advanced cryogenic transmission electron microscopy techniques. Here, we employ in situ liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM) to directly observe the evolution of individual amphiphilic block copolymer micellar nanoparticles in solution, in real time with nanometer spatial resolution. These observations, made on a proof-of-concept bioconjugate polymer amphiphile, revealed growth and evolution occurring by unimer addition processes and by particle--particle collision-and-fusion events. The experimental approach, combining direct LCTEM observation, quantitative analysis of LCTEM data, and correlated in silico simulations, provides a unique view of solvated soft matter nanoassemblies as they morph and evolve in time and space, enabling us to capture these phenomena in solution.},

While such behavior is ubiquitous in natural and synthetic systems, currently there is no general framework to relate the enhancement of a transition rate to the energy dissipated or to bound the enhancement achievable for a given energy expenditure. We employ recent advances in stochastic thermodynamics to build such a framework, which can be used to gain mechanistic insight into transitions far from equilibrium. We show that under general conditions, there is a basic speed limit relating the typical excess heat dissipated throughout a transition and the rate amplification achievable. We illustrate this tradeoff in canonical examples of diffusive barrier crossings in systems driven with autonomous and deterministic external forcing protocols. In both cases, we find that our speed limit tightly constrains the rate enhancement.},

Focusing on Lindblad dynamics, we derive a second bound showing that coherence as a genuine quantum effect inevitably reduces the performance of slow engine cycles regardless of the driving amplitudes. To show how our theory can be applied in practice, we work out a specific example, which lies within the range of current solid-state technologies.},

In brief, any (weakly mixing) random dynamical system that possesses a Markov blanket---i.e. a separation of internal and external states---is equipped with an information geometry. This means that internal states parametrize a probability density over external states. Furthermore, at non-equilibrium steady-state, the flow of internal states can be construed as a gradient flow on a quantity known in statistics as Bayesian model evidence. In short, there is a natural Bayesian mechanics for any system that possesses a Markov blanket. Crucially, this means that there is an explicit link between the inference performed by internal states and their energetics---as characterized by their stochastic thermodynamics.This article is part of the theme issue `Harmonizing energy-autonomous computing and intelligence'.},

In statistical inference theory, information inequalities assert that it is infeasible for any estimator to achieve an error smaller than the prescribed bound. Inspired by the similarity between the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the information inequalities, we apply the latter to systems described by Langevin equations, and we derive the bound for the fluctuation of thermodynamic quantities. When applying the Cram{\'e}r-Rao inequality, the obtained inequality reduces to the fluctuation-response inequality. We find that the thermodynamic uncertainty relation is a particular case of the Cram{\'e}r-Rao inequality, in which the Fisher information is the total entropy production. Using the equality condition of the Cram{\'e}r-Rao inequality, we find that the stochastic total entropy production is the only quantity that can attain equality in the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Furthermore, we apply the Chapman-Robbins inequality and obtain a relation for the lower bound of the ratio between the variance and the sensitivity of systems in response to arbitrary perturbations.},

  abstract = {"Boltzmann's problem" of statistical thermodynamics, is that of eliminating the paradoxical incompatibility of structure, existing between the irreversibility of the classical phenomenological thermodynamics, and the reversibility of any purely kinetic model, one could ever think of for these phenomena. One finds that, in order to construct kinetic "analogs" to the laws of phenomenological thermodynamics, the dynamics of large assemblies of molecules (Liouville theorem, etc,{\textbackslash}cdots) must be completed by some hypotheses of randomness. Once established, this randomness can be followed up in its development, with no new conceptual paradox (although with great technical difficulty: there is a great amount of current work on this topic). But the introduction of randomness still raises entirely uncleared problems. Since, therefore, the kinetic foundations of thermodynamics are not sufficient in the absence of further hypotheses of randomness, are they still quite necessary in the presence of such hypotheses? Or else, could not one "short-circuit" the atoms, by centering upon any elements of randomness, for example those introduced by the process of observation? Our aim is to show (partly after Szilard) that a substantial part of the results, usually obtained through kinetic arguments, could be obtained by postulating from the outset a statistical distribution for the properties of a system, and following up with a purely phenomenological argument. The spirit of the theory is extremely close to that of the conventional (Copenhagen) approach to quantum theory, and the results are quite parallel, although the mathematics is quite different. Randomness is introduced by following the modern statistical theory of the estimation of non directly observable intensive variables of state, such as the temperature. The discussion of the methodological foundations of modern statistics can thus be translated into a full-fledged, and possibly significant , counterpart of the discussion of the kinetic foundations of thermodynamics. Statistics is thus provided with a particularly concrete example for some of its more involved methods; thermodynamics appears clarified in its classical aspects, and is further completed with an apparently new uncertainty relationship. It may also be of interest to the communication engineer to have a unified treatment of the foundations of fluctuation phenomena, and of methods of fighting noise : a discussion of entropy and information performed in this spirit, will be given in Part II of the paper.},

It seems a simple, even unassailable idea: Who would rise to argue in favor of a method of minimum likelihood, or even mediocre likelihood? And yet the mathematical history of the topic shows this ``simple idea'' is really anything but simple. Joseph Louis Lagrange, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonard Euler, Pierre Simon Laplace and Carl Friedrich Gauss are only some of those who explored the topic, not always in ways we would sanction today. In this article, that history is reviewed from back well before Fisher to the time of Lucien Le Cam's dissertation. In the process Fisher's unpublished 1930 characterization of conditions for the consistency and efficiency of maximum likelihood estimates is presented, and the mathematical basis of his three proofs discussed. In particular, Fisher's derivation of the information inequality is seen to be derived from his work on the analysis of variance, and his later approach via estimating functions was derived from Euler's Relation for homogeneous functions. The reaction to Fisher's work is reviewed, and some lessons drawn.},

  abstract = {Although thermodynamic fluctuation theory originated from statistical mechanics, it may be put on a completely thermodynamic basis, in no essential need of any microscopic foundation. This review views the theory from the macroscopic perspective, emphasizing, in particular, notions of covariance and consistency, expressed naturally using the language of Riemannian geometry. Coupled with these concepts is an extension of the basic structure of thermodynamic fluctuation theory beyond the classical one of a subsystem in contact with an infinite uniform reservoir. Used here is a hierarchy of concentric subsystems, each of which samples only the thermodynamic state of the subsystem immediately larger than it. The result is a covariant thermodynamic fluctuation theory which is plausible beyond the standard second-order entropy expansion. It includes the conservation laws and is mathematically consistent when applied to fluctuations inside subsystems. Tests on known models show improvements. Perhaps most significantly, the covariant theory offers a qualitatively new tool for the study of fluctuation phenomena: the Riemannian thermodynamic curvature. The thermodynamic curvature gives, for any given thermodynamic state, a lower bound for the length scale where the classical thermodynamic fluctuation theory based on a uniform environment could conceivably hold. Straightforward computation near the critical point reveals that the curvature equals the correlation volume, a physically appealing finding. The combination of the interpretation of curvature with a well-known proportionality between the free energy and the inverse of the correlation volume yields a purely thermodynamic theory of the critical point. The scaled equation of state follows from the values of the critical exponents. The thermodynamic Riemannian metric may be put into the broader context of information theory.},

The unification arose from a general equation for the rate of change in the information content of a system. The general equation describes the change in the moments of an observable quantity over a probability distribution. One term in the equation describes the change in the probability distribution. The other term describes the change in the observable values for a given state. We show the equivalence of this general equation for moment dynamics with the widely known Price equation from evolutionary theory, named after George Price. We introduce the Price equation from its biological roots, review a mathematically abstract form of the equation, and discuss the potential for this equation to unify diverse mathematical theories from different disciplines. The new work in Nature Physics and many applications in biology show that this equation also provides the basis for deriving many novel theoretical results within each discipline.},

The model is based on the most general thermodynamic ideas and includes the procedures for selection, inheritance, and variability. The problem of finding a universal strategy (principle) as a selection of possible competing strategies is solved. It is shown that when there is non-equilibrium between the medium and agents, a direction in the evolution of agents arises, but at the same time, depending on the conditions of the evolution, different strategies can be successful. However, for this case, the simulation results reveal that in the presence of significant competition of agents, the strategy that has the maximum total energy dissipation of agents arising as a result of evolution turns out to be successful. Thus, it is not the specific strategy that is universal, but the maximization of dissipation. This result discovers an interesting connection between the basic principles of Darwin--Wallace evolution and the maximum entropy production principle.},

This kind of inference scheme is especially useful when the system contains hidden degrees of freedom or hidden discrete states, which are not accessible to the experimentalist. A recent generalization of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation to arbitrary time-dependent driving allows one to infer entropy production not only by measuring current-observables but also by observing state variables. A crucial question then is to understand which observable yields the best estimate for the total entropy production. In this paper we address this question by analyzing the quality of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation for various types of observables for the generic limiting cases of fast driving and slow driving. We show that in both cases observables can be found that yield an estimate of order one for the total entropy production. We further show that the uncertainty relation can even be saturated in the limit of fast driving.},

This problem arises often in the thermodynamics of computation and nonequilibrium statistical physics more generally (e.g. when designing processes to implement some desired computation, feedback controller, or Maxwell demon). It was previously known that some conditional distributions cannot be implemented using any master equation that involves just the states in X. However, here we show that any conditional distribution P can in fact be implemented---if additional `hidden' states not in X are available. Moreover, we show that it is always possible to implement P in a thermodynamically reversible manner. We then investigate a novel cost of the physical resources needed to implement a given distribution P: the minimal number of hidden states needed to do so. We calculate this cost exactly for the special case where P represents a single-valued function, and provide an upper bound for the general case, in terms of the non-negative rank of P. These results show that having access to one extra binary degree of freedom, thus doubling the total number of states, is sufficient to implement any P with a master equation in a thermodynamically reversible way, if there are no constraints on the allowed form of the master equation. (Such constraints can greatly increase the minimal needed number of hidden states.) Our results also imply that for certain P that can be implemented without hidden states, having hidden states permits an implementation that generates less heat.},

Among the different statements of this fundamental property of the full quantum mechanical nature of physical reality, the uncertainty relation for energy and time has a special place. Its interpretation and its consequences have inspired continued research efforts for almost a century. In its modern formulation, the uncertainty relation is understood as setting a fundamental bound on how fast any quantum system can evolve. In this topical review we describe important milestones, such as the Mandelstam--Tamm and the Margolus--Levitin bounds on the quantum speed limit, and summarise recent applications in a variety of current research fields---including quantum information theory, quantum computing, and quantum thermodynamics amongst several others. To bring order and to provide an access point into the many different notions and concepts, we have grouped the various approaches into the minimal time approach and the geometric approach, where the former relies on quantum control theory, and the latter arises from measuring the distinguishability of quantum states. Due to the volume of the literature, this topical review can only present a snapshot of the current state-of-the-art and can never be fully comprehensive. Therefore, we highlight but a few works hoping that our selection can serve as a representative starting point for the interested reader.},

In this Review, the authors collect some of the key theoretical results in quantum parameter estimation by presenting the theory for the quantum estimation of a single parameter, multiple parameters, and optical estimation using Gaussian states. The authors give an overview of results in areas of current research interest, such as Bayesian quantum estimation, noisy quantum metrology, and distributed quantum sensing. The authors address the question of how minimum measurement errors can be achieved using entanglement as well as more general quantum states. This review is presented from a geometric perspective.

  abstract = {The Umkehreinwand of Loschmidt and the Wiederkehreinwand of Zermelo have been reexamined. The former paradox depends on the augument that for a dynamical system, upon the reversal of the velocities of all the molecules, theH function retraces its sequence of values so thatdH/dt will change its sign. The latter paradox depends on the argument that theH function returns infinitely close to its value after a Poincare' quasi-period and therefore cannot be decreasing all the time. While the main contention of the two paradoxes is correct, that theH theorem is inconsistent with classical dynamical laws, the arguments there can be considerably simplified and the ``paradoxes'' answered more directly. If the distribution functionf(qK,pK,t) is governed by an equation which is time-reversal invariant (such as the Liouville equation for a closed dynamical system), then it can be shown immediately thatdH/dt=0,H=cons. In this case, both paradoxes disappear, but together with them, thedH/dt{$<$}0 part of theH theorem also has disappeared, i.e., there is no second law of thermodynamics. Iff(qK,pK,t) is governed by an equation which is not time-reversal invariant (such as the Boltzmann equation, or the Master Equation for Markovian processes), then (1) there is no argument forf andH(t) to retrace their sequence of values upon the reversal of all the velocities of the system, (2) there is no quasiperiod in whichf andH(t) return to their earlier values. In this case, both paradoxes disappear also, but then one must go beyond classical dynamics in order to maintain theH theorem.},

Fluctuation theorems provide fundamental constraints on the dynamics of systems arbitrarily far from thermal equilibrium. Thermodynamic uncertainty relations bound the dissipative cost of precision in a wide variety of processes. Concepts of excess work and excess heat provide the basis for a complete thermodynamics of nonequilibrium steady states, including generalized Clausius relations and thermodynamic potentials. But these general results carry their own limitations: fluctuation theorems involve exponential averages that can depend sensitively on unobservably rare trajectories; steady-state thermodynamics makes use of a dual dynamics that lacks any direct physical interpretation. This review aims to present these central results of contemporary nonequilibrium thermodynamics in such a way that the power of each claim for making physical predictions can be clearly assessed, using examples from current topics in soft matter and biophysics.},

  abstract = {Bohr and Heisenberg suggested that the thermodynamical quantities of temperature and energy are complementary in the same way as position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Roughly speaking their idea was that a definite temperature can be attributed to a system only if it is submerged in a heat bath, in which case energy fluctuations are unavoidable. On the other hand, a definite energy can be assigned only to systems in thermal isolation, thus excluding the simultaneous determination of its temperature. Rosenfeld extended this analogy with quantum mechanics and obtained a quantitative uncertainty relation in the form {$\Delta$}U {$\Delta$}(1/T) {$\geq$} k, where k is Boltzmann's constant. The two ``extreme'' cases of this relation would then characterize this complementarity between isolation (U definite) and contact with a heat bath (T definite). Other formulations of the thermodynamical uncertainty relations were proposed by Mandelbrot (1956, 1989), Lindhard (1986), and Lavenda (1987, 1991). This work, however, has not led to a consensus in the literature. It is shown here that the uncertainty relation for temperature and energy in the version of Mandelbrot is indeed exactly analogous to modern formulations of the quantum mechanical uncertainty relations. However, his relation holds only for the canonical distribution, describing a system in contact with a heat bath. There is, therefore, no complementarily between this situation and a thermally isolated system.},

He is able to do this by using a rich mixture of examples, pictures, and math\- ematical derivations to complement a clear and logical discussion of the important ideas in plain English. The straightforwardness of Kiefer's presentation is remarkable in view of the sophistication and depth of his examination of the major theme: How should an intelligent person formulate a statistical problem and choose a statistical procedure to apply to it? Kiefer's view, in the same spirit as Neyman and Wald, is that one should try to assess the consequences of a statistical choice in some quan\- titative (frequentist) formulation and ought to choose a course of action that is verifiably optimal (or nearly so) without regard to the perceived "attractiveness" of certain dogmas and methods.},

The reaction order in these rate equations is the fixed exponent controlling the dependence of the rate on the number of species. Here, we clarify the relationship between these notions of (dis)order in irreversible decay, n A {$\rightarrow$} B, n = 1, 2, 3, {\dots}, by extending a theoretical measure of fluctuations in the rate coefficient. The measure, Jn-Ln2{$\geq$}0, is the magnitude of the inequality between Jn, the time-integrated square of the rate coefficient multiplied by the time interval of interest, and Ln2, the square of the time-integrated rate coefficient. Applying the inequality to empirical models for non-exponential relaxation, we demonstrate that it quantifies the cumulative deviation in a rate coefficient from a constant, and so the degree of dynamical disorder. The equality is a bound satisfied by traditional kinetics where a single rate constant is sufficient. For these models, we show how increasing the reaction order can increase or decrease dynamical disorder and how, in either case, the inequality Jn-Ln2{$\geq$}0 can indicate the ability to deduce the reaction order in dynamically disordered kinetics.},

However, for nanoscale systems deviations from standard thermodynamics arise due to their interactions with the environment. Here we include such interactions and, using quantum estimation theory, derive a generalised thermodynamic uncertainty relation valid for classical and quantum systems at all coupling strengths. We show that the non-commutativity between the system's state and its effective energy operator gives rise to quantum fluctuations that increase the temperature uncertainty. Surprisingly, these additional fluctuations are described by the average Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information. We demonstrate that the temperature's signal-to-noise ratio is constrained by the heat capacity plus a dissipative term arising from the non-negligible interactions. These findings shed light on the interplay between classical and non-classical fluctuations in quantum thermodynamics and will inform the design of optimal nanoscale thermometers.},

First, we show that the Kolmogorov--Sinai or dynamical entropy can be separated into system and bath components and that the entropy of the system characterizes the dynamics of energy dissipation. Second, we find that the average change in the system dynamical entropy is linearly related to the average change in the energy dissipated to the bath. The constant energy and time scales of the bath fix the dynamical relationship between these two quantities.

In such systems, fluctuations, which are not negligible, follow universal relations such as the fluctuation theorem. More recently, it has been found that, for nonequilibrium stationary states, the full spectrum of fluctuations of any thermodynamic current is bounded by the average rate of entropy production and the average current. However, this bound does not apply to periodically driven systems, such as heat engines driven by periodic variation of the temperature and artificial molecular pumps driven by an external protocol. We obtain a universal bound on current fluctuations for periodically driven systems. This bound is a generalization of the known bound for stationary states. In general, the average rate that bounds fluctuations in periodically driven systems is different from the rate of entropy production. We also obtain a local bound on fluctuations that leads to a trade-off relation between speed and precision in periodically driven systems, which constitutes a generalization to periodically driven systems of the so called thermodynamic uncertainty relation. From a technical perspective, our results are obtained with the use of a recently developed theory for 2.5 large deviations for Markov jump processes with time-periodic transition rates.},

However, few similarly quantitative tools are available for the description of physical systems out of equilibrium. Here, we offer our perspective on the recent development of a new class of inequalities known as thermodynamic uncertainty relations, which have revealed that dissipation constrains current fluctuations in steady states arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We discuss the stochastic thermodynamic origin of these inequalities, and highlight recent efforts to expand their applicability, which have focused on connections between current fluctuations and the fluctuation theorems.},

This generalization facilitates applying the thermodynamic uncertainty relation to single molecule experiments, for which infinite time scales are not accessible. Importantly, often this finite-time variant of the relation allows inferring a bound on the entropy production that is even stronger than the one obtained from the long-time limit. We illustrate the relation for the fluctuating work that is performed by a stochastically switching laser tweezer on a trapped colloidal particle.},

In recent years it has become apparent that the fluctuations of systems far from thermal equilibrium are not mere background noise, but satisfy strong, useful, and unexpected properties.

  abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation--dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

Whether living, synthetic or engineered, systems performing these dynamic functions must balance dissipation and speed. Here, we show that rates of energy and entropy exchange are subject to a speed limit---a time--information uncertainty relation---imposed by the rates of change in the information content of the system. This uncertainty relation bounds the time that elapses before the change in a thermodynamic quantity has the same magnitude as its s.d. From this general bound, we establish a family of speed limits for heat, dissipated/chemical work and entropy depending on the experimental constraints on the system and its environment. In all of these inequalities, the timescale of transient dynamical fluctuations is universally bounded by the Fisher information. Moreover, they all have a mathematical form that mirrors the Mandelstam--Tamm version of the time--energy uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics. These bounds on the speed of arbitrary observables apply to transient systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium, independent of the physical constraints on the stochastic dynamics or their function.},

Their application to experimental systems requires that all relevant mesostates are accessible. Recent advances address the typical situation that only partial, or coarse-grained, information about a system is available. Thermodynamic inference as a general strategy uses consistency constraints derived from stochastic thermodynamics to infer otherwise hidden properties of nonequilibrium systems. An important class in this respect are active particles, for which we resolve the conflicting strategies that have been proposed to identify entropy production. As a paradigm for thermodynamic inference, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation provides a lower bound on the entropy production through measurements of the dispersion of any current in the system. Likewise, it quantifies the cost of precision for biomolecular processes. Generalizations and ramifications allow the inference of, inter alia, model-free upper bounds on the efficiency of molecular motors and of the minimal number of intermediate states in enzymatic networks.},

In particular, for relaxation dynamics, which do not depend on time explicitly, we show that the Fisher information is a monotonically decreasing function of time and that the minimal required time is determined by the initial preparation of the system. We further show that the monotonicity of the Fisher information can be used to detect hidden variables in the system and demonstrate our findings for simple examples of continuous and discrete random processes.},

  abstract = {The Fisher information matrix determines how much information a measurement brings about the parameters that index the underlying probability distribution for the measurement. In this paper we assume that the parameters structure the mean value vector in a multivariate normal distribution. The Fisher matrix is then a Gramian constructed from the sensitivity vectors that characterize the first-order variation in the mean with respect to the parameters. The inverse of the Fisher matrix lower bounds the covariance of any unbiased estimator of the parameters. This inverse has several geometrical properties that bring insight into the problem of identifying multiple parameters. For example, it is the angle between a given sensitivity vector and the linear subspace spanned by all other sensitivity vectors that determines the variance bound for identifying a given parameter. Similarly, the covariance for identifying the linear influence of two different subsets of parameters depends on the principal angles between the linear subspaces spanned by the sensitivity vectors for the respective subsets. These geometrical interpretations may also be given filtering interpretations in a related multivariate normal estimation problem.},

In idealized deterministically driven systems, thermodynamic control can be exerted reversibly, with no entropy production, as long as the rate of the protocol is made slow compared to the equilibration time of the system. Here we consider fully realizable, entropically driven systems where the control parameters themselves obey rules that are reversible and that acquire directionality in time solely through dissipation. We show that when such a system moves in a directed way through thermodynamic space, it must produce entropy that is on average larger than its generalized displacement as measured by the Fisher information metric. This distance measure is subextensive but cannot be made small by slowing the rate of the protocol.},

Using information geometry, we prove that irreversible entropy production is bounded from below by a modified Wasserstein distance between the initial and final states, thus strengthening the Clausius inequality in the reversible-Markov case. The modified metric can be regarded as a discrete-state generalization of the Wasserstein metric, which has been used to bound dissipation in continuous-state Langevin systems. Notably, the derived bounds can be interpreted as the quantum and classical speed limits, implying that the associated entropy production constrains the minimum time of transforming a system state. We illustrate the results on several systems and show that a tighter bound than the Carnot bound for the efficiency of quantum heat engines can be obtained.},

Then we derive the thermodynamic bound on the speed limit to connect two distributions separated by a finite time, showing the effect of the presence of unidirectional transitions. Uncertainty relationships can be found for the temporal first and second moments of the average resetting entropy production. We derive simple expressions in the limit of slow unidirectional transition rates. Finally, we present a refinement of the thermodynamic bound by means of an optimization procedure. We numerically investigate these results on systems that stochastically reset with constant and periodic resetting rate.},

For deterministic protocols, lower bounds on energy dissipation arise from the thermodynamic friction associated with pushing a system out of equilibrium in finite time.

Using stochastic thermodynamics, we compute the total energy cost of an autonomously controlled system by considering both thermodynamic friction and the entropic cost of precisely directing a single control parameter. Our result suggests a challenge to the usual understanding of the adiabatic limit: Here, even infinitely slow protocols are energetically irreversible.},

The entropy constructed here is defined only for equilibrium states and no attempt is made to define it otherwise. Statistical mechanics does not enter these considerations. One of the main concepts that makes everything work is the comparison principle (which, in essence, states that given any two states of the same chemical composition at least one is adiabatically accessible from the other) and we show that it can be derived from some assumptions about the pressure and thermal equilibrium. Temperature is derived from entropy, but at the start not even the concept of `hotness' is assumed. Our formulation offers a certain clarity and rigor that goes beyond most textbook discussions of the second law.},

  abstract = {We study phase transitions and relevant order parameters via statistical estimation theory using the Fisher information matrix. The assumptions that we make limit our analysis to order parameters representable as a negative derivative of thermodynamic potential over some thermodynamic variable. Nevertheless, the resulting representation is sufficiently general and explicitly relates elements of the Fisher information matrix to the rate of change in the corresponding order parameters. The obtained relationships allow us to identify, in particular, second-order phase transitions via divergences of individual elements of the Fisher information matrix. A computational study of random Boolean networks supports the derived relationships, illustrating that Fisher information of the magnetization bias (that is, activity level) is peaked in finite-size networks at the critical points, and the maxima increase with the network size. The framework presented here reveals the basic thermodynamic reasons behind similar empirical observations reported previously. The study highlights the generality of Fisher information as a measure that can be applied to a broad range of systems, particularly those where the determination of order parameters is cumbersome.},

Thus, the dynamics unfolds on a statistical manifold that is automatically endowed by a metric structure provided by information geometry. The curvature of the manifold has a significant influence. We focus our dynamics on the statistical manifold of Gibbs distributions (also known as canonical distributions or the exponential family). The model includes an ``entropic'' notion of time that is tailored to the system under study; the system is its own clock. As one might expect that entropic time is intrinsically directional; there is a natural arrow of time that is led by entropic considerations. As illustrative examples, we discuss dynamics on a space of Gaussians and the discrete three-state system.},

The components of the metric tensor are represented by second moments of stochastic variables. The scalar curvature R, as a geometrical invariant, is a function of the second and third moments, so is strictly connected with fluctuations of the system. In the case of a real gas, R is positive and tends to infinity as the system approaches the critical point. In the case of an ideal gas, R=0. The obtained results, and the results of the authors previous work, suggests that for a wide class of models R tends to + infinity near the critical point. They treat R as a measure of the stability of the system. They propose some sort of statistical principle: only such models may be accepted for which R tends to infinity if the system is approaching the critical point. It is shown that, if this criterion is adopted for a class of models for which the scaling hypothesis holds, then they obtain the new inequalities for the critical indices. These inequalities are in good agreement with model calculations and experiment.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to point out (and to use) the relations of certain statistical concepts with "statistical" thermodynamics. (A) It is observed that Gibbs's "canonical distribution" of energy is precisely what statisticians have later labeled a "distribution of the exponential type". It follows that a rigorous treatment of the canonical law can be based upon the concept of "sufficiency", which is thereby related to the physical idea of "thermal equilibrium" and to the "zero-th principle of thermodynamics". In other words, the theory of physical fluctuations can be based upon "principles" very similar to those of the "phenomenological", or "classical, non-statistical" thermodynamics. Naturally, our results will be less detailed than those of statistical mechanics. However, the foundations of the latter theory still raise a host of unanswered problems, and it seems good in the meantime to show that the less powerful phenomenological theory has a wider scope than is commonly thought (see also [15]). The possibility of a purely phenomenological approach to statistical thermodynamics is not in itself a new idea. A procedure somewhat similar to ours has indeed been long ago suggested in Szilard's admirable, but very difficult and neglected, paper [18]--not to be confused with his [19]. Of course, Szilard used a quite different vocabulary; but, with hindsight, one may now say that he has co-invented the concept of sufficiency with R. A. Fisher; by showing that, under certain regularity conditions, Gibbs's canonical law is the only probability distribution with a single scalar sufficient statistic, Szilard also anticipated the results of G. Darmois [2], B. O. Koopman [10] and E. J. G. Pitman [16], but was partly anticipated by Poincare [17]. (B) The second thesis of the paper is independent of Szilard, and concerns the concept of temperature. For systems with a canonical energy, the temperature is the parameter of the Gibbs distribution; as such it is undefined for isolated systems with a determined energy. However, it is necessary to generalize the concept of temperature to isolated systems. Several definitions have been proposed and, although they all safely converge mutually for the usual very large systems, the temperature remains mathematically ambiguous for small isolated systems; it also becomes physically meaningless. We shall show that the temperature for systems-in-isolation should be viewed as a statistical estimate of the parameter of a conjectural canonical distribution, from which the presently isolated system may be presumed to have once been drawn. This interpretation explains the nature of the ambiguity of the concept of temperature; it also meets the actual practice of physicists; finally, some of the a priori conditions, which the physicists impose upon their "estimators", turn out to correspond to the statistical conditions of consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency. Physicists also use two very interesting variants of consistency and unbiasedness, which we shall study under the names of "self-consistency" and "self-unbiasedness". The most commonly used temperature, due to Ludwig Boltzmann, turns out to be the maximum likelihood estimator. In summary, we hope to show that it is a great pity that mathematical and physical statistics should have developed largely independently of each other, while using the same concepts. By combining the rigor of modern statistics with the intuitive vigor of thermodynamics, both should be served well. However, as things stand, the mathematical statistician should not hope to unearth in the literature of physics any result as yet unknown to him. An important open problem suggested by this paper is the following. When sufficiency and estimation are defined in the most general terms, it seems that one should also be able to generalize the scope of thermodynamics. However, an approach such as that of P. R. Halmos and L. J. Savage [5] could not be applied to thermodynamics without substantial restrictions, as we shall show in Section 7. It remains to study these restrictions in greater detail, before one can assert that a non-void generalization of thermodynamics is possible. The problem is addressed to both mathematicians and physicists. We shall strive to reduce to the minimum the detailed knowledge of physics required to read this paper. If the reader's appetite for information about thermodynamics has been awakened, he could do no better than to make use of references [11] and [20].},

  abstract = {Information geometry emerged from the study of the geometrical structure of a manifold of probability distributions under the criterion of invariance. It defines a Riemannian metric uniquely, which is the Fisher information metric. Moreover, a family of dually coupled affine connections are introduced. Mathematically, this is a study of a triple (M, g, T), where M is a manifold, g is a Riemannian metric, and T is a third-order symmetric tensor. Information geometry has been applied not only to statistical inferences but also to various fields of information sciences where probability plays an important role. Many important families of probability distributions are dually flat Riemannian manifolds. A dually flat manifold possesses a beautiful structure: It has two mutually coupled flat affine connections and two convex functions connected by the Legendre transformation. It has a canonical divergence, from which all the geometrical structure is derived. The KL-divergence in probability distributions is automatically derived from the invariant flat nature. Moreover, the generalized Pythagorean and geodesic projection theorems hold. Conversely, we can define a dually flat Riemannian structure from a convex function. This is derived through the Legendre transformation and Bregman divergence connected with a convex function. Therefore, information geometry is applicable to convex analysis, even when it is not connected with probability distributions. This widens the applicability of information geometry to convex analysis, machine learning, computer vision, Tsallis entropy, economics, and game theory. The present talk summarizes theoretical constituents of information geometry and surveys a wide range of its applications.},

A full knowledge of Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs), especially time-dependent PDFs, becomes essential in understanding far-from-equilibrium processes. We consider a stochastic logistic model with multiplicative noise, which has gamma distributions as stationary PDFs. We numerically solve the transient relaxation problem and show that as the strength of the stochastic noise increases, the time-dependent PDFs increasingly deviate from gamma distributions. For sufficiently strong noise, a transition occurs whereby the PDF never reaches a stationary state, but instead, forms a peak that becomes ever more narrowly concentrated at the origin. The addition of an arbitrarily small amount of additive noise regularizes these solutions and re-establishes the existence of stationary solutions. In addition to diagnostic quantities such as mean value, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis, the transitions between different solutions are analysed in terms of entropy and information length, the total number of statistically-distinguishable states that a system passes through in time.},

  abstract = {A probabilistic description is essential for understanding the dynamics of stochastic systems far from equilibrium, given uncertainty inherent in the systems. To compare different Probability Density Functions (PDFs), it is extremely useful to quantify the difference among different PDFs by assigning an appropriate metric to probability such that the distance increases with the difference between the two PDFs. This metric structure then provides a key link between stochastic systems and information geometry. For a non-equilibrium process, we define an infinitesimal distance at any time by comparing two PDFs at times infinitesimally apart and sum these distances in time. The total distance along the trajectory of the system quantifies the total number of different states that the system undergoes in time and is called the information length. By using this concept, we investigate the information geometry of non-equilibrium processes involved in disorder-order transitions between the critical and subcritical states in a bistable system. Specifically, we compute time-dependent PDFs, information length, the rate of change in information length, entropy change and Fisher information in disorder-to-order and order-to-disorder transitions and discuss similarities and disparities between the two transitions. In particular, we show that the total information length in order-to-disorder transition is much larger than that in disorder-to-order transition and elucidate the link to the drastically different evolution of entropy in both transitions. We also provide the comparison of the results with those in the case of the transition between the subcritical and supercritical states and discuss implications for fitness.},

In this metric space, we find a geodesic for which the information propagates at constant speed, and demonstrate its utility as an optimal path to reduce the total time and total dissipated energy. In particular, through examples of physical realizations of such geodesic solutions satisfying boundary conditions, we present a resonance phenomenon in the geodesic solution and the discretization into cyclic geodesic solutions.

  abstract = {We investigate the time-evolution of a non-equilibrium system in view of the change in information and provide a novel mapping relation which quantifies the change in information far from equilibrium and the proximity of a non-equilibrium state to the attractor. Specifically, we utilize a nonlinear stochastic model where the stochastic noise plays the role of incoherent regulation of the dynamical variable x and analytically compute the rate of change in information (information velocity) from the time-dependent probability distribution function. From this, we quantify the total change in information in terms of information length and the associated action , where represents the distance that the system travels in the fluctuation-based, statistical metric space parameterized by time. As the initial probability density function's mean position ({$\mu$}) is decreased from the final equilibrium value (the carrying capacity), and increase monotonically with interesting power-law mapping relations. In comparison, as {$\mu$} is increased from and increase slowly until they level off to a constant value. This manifests the proximity of the state to the attractor caused by a strong correlation for large {$\mu$} through large fluctuations. Our proposed mapping relation provides a new way of understanding the progression of the complexity in non-equilibrium system in view of information change and the structure of underlying attractor.},

When additional information such as the initial and final states or moments of an observable is available, it is known that tighter lower bounds on the entropy production exist according to the classical speed limits and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Here we obtain a universal lower bound on the total entropy production in terms of probability distributions of an observable in the time forward and backward processes. For a particular case, we show that our universal relation reduces to a classical speed limit, imposing a constraint on the speed of the system's evolution in terms of the Hatano-Sasa entropy production. Notably, the obtained classical speed limit is tighter than the previously reported bound by a constant factor. Moreover, we demonstrate that a generalized thermodynamic uncertainty relation can be derived from another particular case of the universal relation. Our uncertainty relation holds for systems with time-reversal symmetry breaking and recovers several existing bounds. Our approach provides a unified perspective on two closely related classes of inequality: classical speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations.},

In contrast to the scalar-valued observables examined previously, this multidimensional thermodynamic uncertainty relation provides a natural way to study currents in high-dimensional systems and to obtain relations between different observables. Our proof is based on the generalized Cr{\'a}mer--Rao inequality, which we interpret as a relation between physical observables and the Fisher information. This allows us to develop high-dimensional versions of both the original, steady state uncertainty relation and the more recently obtained generalized uncertainty relation for time-periodic systems. We apply the multidimensional uncertainty relation to obtain a new constraint on the performance of steady-state heat engines, which is tighter than previous bounds and reveals the role of heat-work correlations. As a second application, we show that the uncertainty relation is connected to a bound on the differential mobility. As a result of this connection, we find that a necessary condition for equality in the uncertainty relation is that the system obeys the equilibrium fluctuation--dissipation relation.},

We study the response of an observable to a perturbation of the underlying stochastic dynamics. We find that the magnitude of the response is bounded from above by the fluctuations of the observable in the unperturbed system and the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the probability densities describing the perturbed and the unperturbed system. This establishes a connection between linear response and concepts of information theory. We show that in many physical situations, the relative entropy may be expressed in terms of physical observables. As a direct consequence of this FRI, we show that for steady-state particle transport, the differential mobility is bounded by the diffusivity. For a ``virtual'' perturbation proportional to the local mean velocity, we recover the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for steady-state transport processes. Finally, we use the FRI to derive a generalization of the uncertainty relation to arbitrary dynamics, which involves higher-order cumulants of the observable. We provide an explicit example, in which the TUR is violated but its generalization is satisfied with equality.},

  abstract = {The rapid recent progress in machine learning (ML) has raised a number of scientific questions that challenge the longstanding dogma of the field. One of the most important riddles is the good empirical generalization of overparameterized models. Overparameterized models are excessively complex with respect to the size of the training dataset, which results in them perfectly fitting (i.e., interpolating) the training data, which is usually noisy. Such interpolation of noisy data is traditionally associated with detrimental overfitting, and yet a wide range of interpolating models -- from simple linear models to deep neural networks -- have recently been observed to generalize extremely well on fresh test data. Indeed, the recently discovered double descent phenomenon has revealed that highly overparameterized models often improve over the best underparameterized model in test performance. Understanding learning in this overparameterized regime requires new theory and foundational empirical studies, even for the simplest case of the linear model. The underpinnings of this understanding have been laid in very recent analyses of overparameterized linear regression and related statistical learning tasks, which resulted in precise analytic characterizations of double descent. This paper provides a succinct overview of this emerging theory of overparameterized ML (henceforth abbreviated as TOPML) that explains these recent findings through a statistical signal processing perspective. We emphasize the unique aspects that define the TOPML research area as a subfield of modern ML theory and outline interesting open questions that remain.},

Bayes put forward, with considerable caution, a method by which such problems could be reduced to the form of problems of probability. His method of doing this depended essentially on postualting a priori knowledge, not of the particular population of which our observations from a sample, but of an imaginary population of populations from which this population was regarded as having been drawn at random. Clearly, if we have possession of such a priori knowledge, our problem is not properly an inductive one at all, for the population under discussion is then regarded merely as a particular case of a general type, of which we already possess exact knowledge, and are therefore in a positioin to draw exact deductive inferences. To the merit of broaching a fundamentally important problem, Bayes added that of perceiving, much more clearly than some of his followers have done, the logical weakness of the form of solutiion he put forward. Indeed we are told that it was his doubts respecting the validity of the postulate needed for establishing the method of inverse probability that led to this withholding his entire treatise from publication. Actually it was not published until after his death.},

The Koopman operator has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics, and its eigenfunctions establish intrinsic coordinates along which the dynamics behave linearly. Previous studies have used finite-dimensional approximations of the Koopman operator for model-predictive control approaches. In this work, we illustrate a fundamental closure issue of this approach and argue that it is beneficial to first validate eigenfunctions and then construct reduced-order models in these validated eigenfunctions. These coordinates form a Koopman-invariant subspace by design and, thus, have improved predictive power. We show then how the control can be formulated directly in these intrinsic coordinates and discuss potential benefits and caveats of this perspective. The resulting control architecture is termed Koopman Reduced Order Nonlinear Identification and Control (KRONIC). It is further demonstrated that these eigenfunctions can be approximated with data-driven regression and power series expansions, based on the partial differential equation governing the infinitesimal generator of the Koopman operator. Validating discovered eigenfunctions is crucial and we show that lightly damped eigenfunctions may be faithfully extracted from EDMD or an implicit formulation. These lightly damped eigenfunctions are particularly relevant for control, as they correspond to nearly conserved quantities that are associated with persistent dynamics, such as the Hamiltonian. KRONIC is then demonstrated on a number of relevant examples, including (a) a nonlinear system with a known linear embedding, (b) a variety of Hamiltonian systems, and (c) a high-dimensional double-gyre model for ocean mixing.},

Almost by definition, time has an arrow. In contrast, time reversibility, or even the possibility to run the equations of motion backwards in time, is not at all a primary requirement. This means that the direction of the arrow of time may well be uniquely defined in the theory, even locally. It is explained that a rigorous definition of time, as well as a formulation of the causality and locality concepts, can only be given when one has a model for the physical phenomena described. The only viable causality condition is one that is symmetric under time reversal. We explain these statements in terms of the author's favored deterministic cellular automaton interpretation of quantum mechanics, also to be referred to as ``vector space analysis,'' and expand on these ideas. It is also summarized how our more rigorous causality condition affects Bell's theorems. What distinguishes quantum systems from classical ones is our fundamental inability to control the microscopic details of the initial state when phenomena are studied in the light of some theoretical model.},

In such an operational perspective, time is defined and measured by a clock, i.e. the comparison with a given physical phenomenon. A central notion is that of time scales. I argue that the representation of time (e.g. discrete vs. continuous) is essentially a modeling choice, depending on the time scale of the observation or description compared to the characteristic times of the system. In integrated approaches developed for investigating systems presenting several levels of organization, it may be fruitful to consider several independent time variables describing evolution at different nested time scales (``multiple scale method''). This would solve some puzzling but recurrent statements, such as an evolution composed of a succession of equilibrium states, and leads to a practical understanding of diverse systems, from combustion and kinetic theory of gases in physics to enzymatic catalysis in biochemistry to adaptive dynamics in ecology. At a more fundamental level, the confrontation of descriptions performed at different scales and within different frameworks, from molecular dynamics to statistical mechanics to thermodynamics, is essential to delineate the limits of each of them, and overall reach a more informative understanding of reality. In particular, such a multi-scale confrontation offers a simple answer to the long-lasting opposition between microscopic reversibility and macroscopic irreversibility of isolated systems (the celebrated Second Principle of the thermodynamics). In biology, time scales are also essential in discussing the robustness of living systems and their evolutionary strategies.},

To this end, we propose a discrete version of L which is mathematically well defined by taking a set theoretic approach.

We thus disprove the hypotheses that a general evolution principle of thermodynamics based on the decrease of the nonadiabatic entropy production could hold. However, we argue that a large separation of typical decay times is necessary for nonconvex solutions to occur, making concave transients extremely short lived with respect to the main relaxation modes. We describe a general method based on the Fisher information matrix to discriminate between generators that admit nonconvex solutions and those that do not. While initial conditions leading to concave transients are shown to be extremely fine-tuned, by our method we are able to select nonconvex initial conditions that are arbitrarily close to the steady state. Convexity does occur when the system is close to satisfying detailed balance or, more generally, when certain normality conditions of the decay modes are satisfied. Our results circumscribe the range of validity of a conjecture by Maes et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 010601 (2011)] regarding monotonicity of the large deviation rate functional for the occupation probability, showing that while the conjecture might hold in the long-time limit, the conditions for Lyapunov's second criterion for stability are not met.},

However, when the estimated parameter values are required to satisfy inequality constraints such as positivity, the resulting estimator is typically biased. To calculate CRBs for biased estimates of the parameter values, an expression for the bias gradient matrix must also be known. Unfortunately, this expression often does not exist. Because expressions for biased CRBs are preferable to sample variance calculations, alternative methods for deriving biased CRB expressions associated with inequality constraints are needed. We present an alternative approach that is based upon creating the probability density function associated with a given biased estimate of these parameters using the available knowledge of the estimator properties. We apply this approach to the calculation of biased CRBs for estimators that use a positivity constraint with and without a support constraint for a specific measurement model and discuss the benefits and limitations of this approach.},

Here we explore an alternative approach, namely physical coupled learning. In this paradigm, the system is not initially designed to accomplish a task, but physically adapts to applied forces to develop the ability to perform the task. Crucially, we require coupled learning to be facilitated by physically plausible learning rules, meaning that learning requires only local responses and no explicit information about the desired functionality. We show that such local learning rules can be derived for any physical network, whether in equilibrium or in steady state, with specific focus on two particular systems, namely disordered flow networks and elastic networks. By applying and adapting advances of statistical learning theory to the physical world, we demonstrate the plausibility of new classes of smart metamaterials capable of adapting to users' needs in situ.},

However, developing synthetic, inanimate embodiments of a chemomechanical framework to generate non-reciprocal interactions of tunable strength and directionality has been challenging. Here we show how chemotactic signalling between microscale oil droplets of different chemistries in micellar surfactant solutions can result in predator--prey-like non-reciprocal chasing interactions. The interactions and dynamic self-organization result from the net directional, micelle-mediated transport of oil between emulsion droplets of differing composition and are powered by the free energy of mixing. We systematically elucidated chemical design rules to tune the interactions between droplets by varying the oil and surfactant chemical structure and concentration. Through the integration of experiment and simulation, we also investigated the active behaviour and dynamic reorganization of multidroplet clusters. Our findings demonstrate how chemically minimal systems can be designed with controllable, non-reciprocal chemotactic interactions to generate emergent self-organization and collective behaviours reminiscent of biological systems.},

We develop here a scalable and non-parametric framework to characterise the presence of heterogeneity and correlations in a complex system, based on normalised mean first passage times between preassigned classes of nodes. We showcase a variety of concrete applications, including the quantification of polarisation in the UK Brexit referendum and the roll-call votes in the US Congress, the identification of key players in disease spreading, and the comparison of spatial segregation of US cities.

Since a quantum ensemble in general consists of mixed states, it is desirable to extend the concept of Gram matrix to the case of mixed states. By employing two prominent notions of overlap between mixed states, i.e., quantum affinity and quantum fidelity, one can readily extend the concept of Gram matrices of pure-state ensembles to that of mixed-state ensembles. We study these two extended versions of Gram matrices and reveal their fundamental properties. It is remarkable that while Gram matrix based on quantum affinity is non-negative definite (and thus can be regarded as a quantum state in a fictious system), the one based on quantum fidelity may fail to be non-negative definite. As applications of Gram matrices of mixed-state ensembles, we introduce two quantifiers of quantumness of ensembles via coherence of the corresponding Gram matrices, investigate their properties, and illustrate them in the qubit case.},

  abstract = {Because time does not appear in Schr{\"o}dinger's equation as an operator but only as a parameter, the time-energy uncertainty relation must be formulated in a special way. This problem has in fact been studied by many authors and we give a summary of their treatments. We then criticize the main conclusion of these treatments; viz., that in a measurement of energy carried out in a time interval, {$\Delta$}t{$\Delta$}t, there must be a minimum uncertainty in the transfer of energy to the observed system, given by {$\Delta$}(E{$\prime-$}E){$>$}{\textasciitilde}h{$\Delta$}t. We show that this conclusion is erroneous in two respects. First, it is not consistent with the general principles of the quantum theory, which require that all uncertainty relations be expressible in terms of the mathematical formalism, i.e., by means of operators, wave functions, etc. Secondly, the examples of measurement processes that were used to derive the above uncertainty relation are not general enough. We then develop a systematic presentation of our own point of view, with regard to the role of time in the quantum theory, and give a concrete example of a measurement process not satisfying the above uncertainty relation.},

It establishes a relationship between the linear response of a system under a time-dependent perturbation and time correlations of certain observables in equilibrium. Here we derive a generalization of the theorem which can be applied to any Markov quantum system and makes use of the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD). There are several important benefits from our approach. First, such a formulation clarifies the relation between classical and quantum versions of the equilibrium FDT. Second, and more important, it facilitates the extension of the FDT to arbitrary quantum Markovian evolutions, as given by quantum maps. Third, it brings out the full connection between the FDT and the Quantum Fisher information, the figure of merit in quantum metrology.},

One set of experiments includes a functional module consisting of a duplex and two fluorophore-labeled strands. The fuel-triggered activation of the functional module leads to a supramolecular intermediate composed of a template bound to the two fluorophore-labeled strands. Nicking of the fuel strand by Nt.BbvCI yields ``waste'' products, resulting in the regeneration of original system. The transient dissipative behavior of the systems is probed by following the FRET signal generated by the fluorophore labels associated with the intermediate supramolecular complex. The second set of experiments introduces two functional modules activated in parallel by the fuel strand. Using two inhibitors, I1 or I2, the selective gated dissipative operation of the networks is demonstrated. Finally, experiments presenting the intercommunication and cascading of two dissipative networks are introduced. Subjecting the networks to the fuel strands leads to intercommunication between the networks by strand-transfer and strand-feedback processes, allowing the cascaded dissipative operation of the assembly. The experimental results of the different dissipative systems are accompanied by kinetic models and computational simulations. The computational simulations provide useful means to predict the dissipative transient patterns of the systems at different auxiliary conditions.},

Here we present a simple chemical network in which the selection of states is driven by the thermodynamic necessity of dissipating heat as rapidly as possible in the presence of a thermal gradient: states participating to faster reactions contribute the most to the dissipation rate, and are the most populated ones in non-equilibrium steady-state conditions. Building upon these results, we show that, as the complexity of the chemical network increases, the velocity of the reaction path leading to a given state determines its selection, giving rise to non-trivial localization phenomena in state space. A byproduct of our studies is that, in the presence of a temperature gradient, thermophoresis-like behavior inevitably appears depending on the transport properties of each individual state, thus hinting at a possible microscopic explanation of this intriguing yet still not fully understood phenomenon.},

Various relaxations of these bounds allow to recover well known bounds such as (strengthenings of) Cramer-Rao's and Pinsker's inequalities. In particular we obtain a master inequality, named Symmetric Response Intensity Relation, which recovers several TURs as particular cases. We employ this set of bounds for three physical applications. First, we derive a trade-off between thermodynamic cost (dissipated free energy) and reliability of systems switching instantly between two states, such as one-bit memories. We derive in particular a lower bound of \$2.8 k\_BT\$ per Shannon bit to write a bit in such a memory, a bound distinct from Landauer's one. Second, we obtain a new family of classic speed limits which provide lower bounds for non-autonomous Markov processes on the time needed to transition between two probabilistic states in terms of a thermodynamic quantity (e.g. non-equilibrium free energy) and a kinetic quantity (e.g. dynamical activity). Third, we provide an upper bound on the nonlinear response of a system based solely on the `complexity' of the system (which we relate to a high entropy and non-uniformity of the probabilities). We find that `complex' models (e.g. with many states) are necessarily fragile to some perturbations, while simple systems are robust, in that they display a low response to arbitrary perturbations.},

While extensive studies have made efforts to obtain rigorous constraints on dynamical processes since Mandelstam and Tamm, speed limits that provide tight bounds for macroscopic transitions have remained elusive. Here, by employing the continuity equation of probability, the fundamental principle in physics, we develop a general framework for deriving much tighter speed limits for macroscopic systems than many conventional speed limits. We show that the speed of the expectation value of an observable defined on a general graph is bounded by the "smoothness" of the observable and the local probability current. As a primary application for our framework, we derive quantum speed limits for macroscopic unitary dynamics. Unlike previous bounds, the speed limit includes the expectation value of the transition Hamiltonian, which can decrease the speed because of the suppression of the quantum phase difference of the state. We also find for the first time that, beyond expectation values of macroscopic observables, the speed of macroscopic quantum coherence can be bounded from above by our general approach. The newly obtained bounds are verified in transport phenomena in particle systems and relaxation dynamics in many-body spin systems. We also demonstrate that our strategy can be applied for finding speed limits for macroscopic transitions in classical and quantum stochastic systems, where the bounds are expressed by the standard or Hatano-Sasa entropy production rate. Our work paves the way toward discovering novel speed limits on the basis of continuity equations, which can provide unprecedented fundamental limits to various nonequilibrium macroscopic phenomena.},

However, these theorems ignore that many systems are not monolithic, but instead comprise multiple subsystems that interact according to an (often sparse) network. Indeed, most naturally-occurring and human-engineered systems of increasing complexity can be decomposed into sets of co-evolving subsystems, where there exist a priori constraints on the dynamics of each subsystem, restricting which other subsystems can affect its dynamics. Here we derive three new SLTs that account for the thermodynamic effects of such constraints. Our first new speed limit strengthens the global speed limit. While our other two SLTs do not have this guarantee, in some situations they are even stronger than our first speed limit. Our results establish that a stochastically evolving system will, on average, produce more entropy in evolving between two distributions within a given time simply due to its comprising multiple, co-evolving subsystems. We illustrate our results with numerical calculations involving a model of two cells sensing and storing information about their environment.},

The role played by the modification has been elucidated in the present study. We argue that the virial theorem is practically violated in finite-time simulations of the modified log-oscillator illustrated by a linear dependence of kinetic temperature on energy. Furthermore, as far as a thermalized log-oscillator is concerned, our calculation based on the canonical ensemble average shows that the generalized equipartition theorem is broken if the temperature is higher than a critical temperature. Finally, we show that log-oscillators fail to serve as thermostats for their incapability of maintaining a nonequilibrium steady state even though their energy is appropriately assigned.},

We derive a time-energy uncertainty relation for open quantum systems undergoing a general, completely positive, and trace preserving evolution which provides a bound to the quantum speed limit. When the evolution is of the Lindblad form, the bound is analogous to the Mandelstam-Tamm relation which applies in the unitary case, with the role of the Hamiltonian being played by the adjoint of the generator of the dynamical semigroup. The utility of the new bound is exemplified in different scenarios, ranging from the estimation of the passage time to the determination of precision limits for quantum metrology in the presence of dephasing noise.},

Within the linear-response regime, this metric structure controls the dissipation of finite-time transformations, and bestows optimal protocols with many useful properties.

We show that increasing the number of measured observables will always produce a tighter bound. This tighter bound becomes particularly useful if one of the observables is a conserved quantity, whose expectation is invariant under a given perturbation of the system. For the case of the TUR, we show that this applies to any function of the state of the system. The resulting correlation TUR takes into account the correlations between a current and a noncurrent observable, thereby tightening the TUR. We demonstrate our finding on a model of the F1-ATPase molecular motor, a Markov jump model consisting of two rings and transport through a two-dimensional channel. We find that the correlation TUR is significantly tighter than the TUR and can be close to an equality even far from equilibrium.},

Here, using entropy production as an example, we show how thermodynamic uncertainty relations and speed limits on these nonlinear processes derive from linear regression. These uncertainty relations hold for both passive and actively-driven nonequilibrium processes and all have a mathematical form that mirrors uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics. Using optimal linear models, we show that information-theoretic variables naturally give physical predictions of the equation of motion on statistical manifolds in terms of physical observables. In these models, optimal intercepts are related to nonequilibrium analogs of Massieu functions/thermodynamic potentials, and optimal slopes are related to speed limits on collections of thermodynamic observables. Within this formalism, the second law of thermodynamics has a geometric interpretation as the nonnegativity of the slope and constrains the equation of motion. Overall, our results suggest that unknown relationships between nonequilibrium variables can be learned through statistical-mechanical inference.},

These earlier derivations may be classed as quasi-thermodynamic; in fact, Thomson himself pointed out that his argument was incomplete, and that his relation ought to be established on an experimental basis. A general class of such relations will be derived by a new theoretical treatment from the principle of microscopic reversibility. ({\S}{\S}1-2.) The analogy with a chemical monomolecular triangle reaction is discussed; in this case a a simple kinetic consideration assuming microscopic reversibility yields a reciprocal relation that is not necessary for fulfilling the requirements of thermodynamics ({\S}3). Reciprocal relations for heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are derived from the assumption of microscopic reversibility, applied to fluctuations. ({\S}4.) The reciprocal relations can be expressed in terms of a potential, the dissipation-function. Lord Rayleigh's "principle of the least dissipation of energy" is generalized to include the case of anisotropic heat conduction. A further generalization is announced. ({\S}5.)

A lower bound on the average mean-square error is derived. This new bound is based on the Cram{\'e}r-Rao inequality. The conventional Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound is not directly applicable, because it requires the knowledge of the bias function, which is difficult to find in a recursive estimation scheme. To avoid this difficulty, we introduce the concept of most favorable bias function and use the calculus of variations to derive the lower bound. The new bound also serves as a standard to judge the merits of the stochastic-estimation algorithm, since under some general conditions no estimate can yield smaller error. It is shown that under some conditions the two bounds are nearly equal, and hence the algorithm is near optimal. The asymptotic efficiency of the algorithm is compared with Sakrison's result. A stochastic-estimation algorithm is derived for estimating Doppler frequency, and performance curves in terms of the error bounds are presented.},

In the case in which the measurements are related to the unknown parameters through a linear Gaussian model, Tikhonov regularization is shown to achieve the UCRLB when the Frobenius norm is considered, and the shrunken estimator is shown to achieve the UCRLB when the spectral norm is considered. For more general models, the penalized maximum likelihood (PML) estimator with a suitable penalizing function is shown to asymptotically achieve the UCRLB. To establish the asymptotic optimality of the PML estimator, we first develop the asymptotic mean and variance of the PML estimator for any choice of penalizing function satisfying certain regularity constraints and then derive a general condition on the penalizing function under which the resulting PML estimator asymptotically achieves the UCRLB.

  abstract = {Propagation of error is a widely used estimation tool in experiments where the estimation precision of the parameter depends on the fluctuation of the physical observable. Thus the observable that is chosen will greatly affect the estimation sensitivity. Here we study the optimal observable for the ultimate sensitivity bounded by the quantum Cram{\'e}r--Rao theorem in parameter estimation. By invoking the Schr{\"o}dinger--Robertson uncertainty relation, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal observables saturating the ultimate sensitivity for the single parameter estimate. By applying this condition to Greenberg--Horne--Zeilinger states, we obtain the general expression of the optimal observable for separable measurements to achieve the Heisenberg-limit precision and show that it is closely related to the parity measurement. However, Jose et al (2013 Phys. Rev. A 87 022330) have claimed that the Heisenberg limit may not be obtained via separable measurements. We show this claim is incorrect.},

  abstract = {Quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) is a core concept in theoretical quantum metrology due to the significant importance of quantum Cram{\'e}r--Rao bound in quantum parameter estimation. However, studies in recent years have revealed wide connections between QFIM and other aspects of quantum mechanics, including quantum thermodynamics, quantum phase transition, entanglement witness, quantum speed limit and non-Markovianity. These connections indicate that QFIM is more than a concept in quantum metrology, but rather a fundamental quantity in quantum mechanics. In this paper, we summarize the properties and existing calculation techniques of QFIM for various cases, and review the development of QFIM in some aspects of quantum mechanics apart from quantum metrology. On the other hand, as the main application of QFIM, the second part of this paper reviews the quantum multiparameter Cram{\'e}r--Rao bound, its attainability condition and the associated optimal measurements. Moreover, recent developments in a few typical scenarios of quantum multiparameter estimation and the quantum advantages are also thoroughly discussed in this part.},

Therefore one purpose of this book is to show that statistical parameter estimation has much more to offer than least squares estimation alone. In the approach of this book, knowledge of the distribution of the observations is involved in the choice of estimators. A further advantage of the chosen approach is that it unifies the underlying theory and reduces it to a relatively small collection of coherent, generally applicable principles and notions.},

Remarkably, for the disordered nonintegrable system we consider the long time dynamics are in good agreement with the rigorously obtained short time behavior and with previous obtained numerically exact results, suggesting that at least in this case, the apparent convergence of this approach is reliable. Our study indicates that, while great care must be exercised in establishing the convergence of the method, it may still be asymptotically accurate for a class of disordered nonintegrable quantum systems.},

Rather than a Suzuki-Trotter splitting of the Hamiltonian, which is the idea behind the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method or time-evolving block decimation, our method is based on splitting the projector onto the matrix product state tangent space as it appears in the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle. We discuss how the resulting algorithm resembles the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for finding ground states so closely that it can be implemented by changing just a few lines of code and it inherits the same stability and efficiency. In particular, our method is compatible with any Hamiltonian for which ground-state DMRG can be implemented efficiently. In fact, DMRG is obtained as a special case of our scheme for imaginary time evolution with infinite time step.},

The primary photochemical reaction of vision, the isomerization of retinal in the protein rhodopsin, is known to be a vibrationally coherent reaction, but the Franck--Condon factors responsible for initiating the process have been difficult to resolve with conventional time-resolved spectroscopies. Here we employ experimental and theoretical 2D photon echo spectroscopy to directly resolve for the first time the Franck--Condon factors that initiate isomerization on the excited potential energy surface and track the reaction dynamics. The spectral dynamics reveal vibrationally coherent isomerization occurring on the fastest possible time scale, that of a single period of the local torsional reaction coordinate. We successfully model this process as coherent wavepacket motion through a conical intersection on a {$\sim$}30 fs time scale, confirming the reaction coordinate as a local torsional coordinate with a frequency of {$\sim$}570 cm--1. As a result of spectral features being spread out along two frequency coordinates, we unambiguously assign reactant and product states following passage through the conical intersection, which reveal the key vibronic transitions that initiate the vibrationally coherent photochemistry of vision.},

Approaches that incorporate machine learning can help address this limitation and accelerate the discovery of materials with targeted properties. In this article, we review how to leverage machine learning to reduce dimensionality in order to effectively explore design space, accelerate property evaluation, and generate unconventional material structures with optimal properties.

Before this goal can be realized, however, we must learn how to control the coupling/uncoupling to the environment of individual switchable molecules, and also how to integrate these bistable molecules into organized, hierarchical assemblies that can perform significant work on their immediate environment at nano-, micro- and macroscopic levels. In this tutorial review, we seek to draw an all-important distinction between artificial molecular switches which are now ten a penny---or a dime a dozen---in the chemical literature and artificial molecular machines which are few and far between despite the ubiquitous presence of their naturally occurring counterparts in living systems. At the single molecule level, a prevailing perspective as to how machine-like characteristics may be achieved focuses on harnessing, rather than competing with, the ineluctable effects of thermal noise. At the macroscopic level, one of the major challenges inherent to the construction of machine-like assemblies lies in our ability to control the spatial ordering of switchable molecules---e.g., into linear chains and then into muscle-like bundles---and to influence the cross-talk between their switching kinetics. In this regard, situations where all the bistable molecules switch synchronously appear desirable for maximizing mechanical power generated. On the other hand, when the bistable molecules switch ``out of phase,'' the assemblies could develop intricate spatial or spatiotemporal patterns. Assembling and controlling synergistically artificial molecular machines housed in highly interactive and robust architectural domains heralds a game-changer for chemical synthesis and a defining moment for nanofabrication.},

Recent research focus on nonequilibrium processes in stochastic systems has revealed a fundamental trade-off, called dissipation-time uncertainty relation, that entropy production rate associated with dissipation bounds the evolution pace of physical processes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 120604 (2020)]. Following the dissipative two-level model exemplified in the same Letter, we experimentally verify this fundamental trade-off in a single trapped ultracold 40Ca+ ion using elaborately designed dissipative channels, along with a postprocessing method developed in the data analysis, to build the effective nonequilibrium stochastic evolutions for the energy transfer between two heat baths mediated by a qubit. Since the dissipation-time uncertainty relation imposes a constraint on the quantum speed regarding entropy flux, our observation provides the first experimental evidence confirming such a speed restriction from thermodynamics on quantum operations due to dissipation, which helps us further understand the role of thermodynamical characteristics played in quantum information processing.},

  abstract = {Diffusive dynamics in presence of deep energy minima and weak nongradient forces can be coarse grained into a mesoscopic jump process over the various basins of attraction. Combining standard weak-noise results with a path integral expansion around equilibrium, we show that the emerging transition rates satisfy local detailed balance (LDB). Namely, the log ratio of the transition rates between nearby basins of attractions equals the free-energy variation appearing at equilibrium, supplemented by the work done by the nonconservative forces along the typical transition path. When the mesoscopic dynamics possesses a large-size deterministic limit, it can be further reduced to a jump process over macroscopic states satisfying LDB. The persistence of LDB under coarse graining of weakly nonequilibrium states is a generic consequence of the fact that only dissipative effects matter close to equilibrium.},

When microstates within mesostates rapidly thermalize, the entire structure of the microscopic theory is recovered at the mesostate level. This is not the case when these microstates remain out of equilibrium, leading to additional contributions to the entropy balance.

  abstract = {Thermal contact is the archetype of non-equilibrium processes driven by constant non-equilibrium constraints when the latter are enforced by reservoirs exchanging conserved microscopic quantities. At a mesoscopic scale only the energies of the macroscopic bodies are accessible together with the configurations of the contact system. We consider a class of models where the contact system, as well as macroscopic bodies, have a finite number of possible configurations. The global system, with only discrete degrees of freedom, has no microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics, but it is shown that, if the microscopic dynamics is assumed to be deterministic and ergodic and to conserve energy according to some specific pattern, and if the mesoscopic evolution of the global system is approximated by a Markov process as closely as possible, then the mesoscopic transition rates obey three constraints. In the limit where macroscopic bodies can be considered as reservoirs at thermodynamic equilibrium (but with different intensive parameters), the mesoscopic transition rates turn into transition rates for the contact system and the third constraint becomes local detailed balance; the latter is generically expressed in terms of the microscopic exchange entropy variation, namely the opposite of the variation of the thermodynamic entropy of the reservoir involved in a given microscopic jump of the contact system configuration. For a finite-time evolution after contact has been switched on, we derive a fluctuation relation for the joint probability of the heat amounts received from the various reservoirs. The generalization to systems exchanging energy, volume and matter with several reservoirs, with a possible conservative external force acting on the contact system, is given explicitly.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of statistical mechanics is to give a microscopic derivation of macroscopic laws, including in particular the celebrated second law of thermodynamics. In recent years, there have been spectacular developments in this respect, including the integral and detailed work fluctuation theorems and the theory of stochastic thermodynamics. Here we give a brief introduction to these developments. In the first step, we derive the first and second law of thermodynamics for a Markovian stochastic process at the ensemble level, including two major advances: 1) the theory can be applied to small-scale systems including the effect of fluctuations, 2) the theory is not restricted to near-equilibrium dynamics. As an application, we evaluate the efficiency at maximum power of a two-state quantum dot. We also briefly discuss the connection to information-to-work conversion (Landauer principle) and the splitting of the second law into an adiabatic and nonadiabatic component. In a second step we formulate stochastic thermodynamics at the trajectory level, introducing stochastic trajectory-dependent quantities such as stochastic entropy, energy, heat, and work. Both the first and the second law can be formulated at this trajectory level. Concerning the second law, the crucial observation is that the stochastic entropy production can be written as the logarithm of the ratio of path probabilities. This in turn implies a detailed and integral work and fluctuation theorem, linking the probability to observe a given stochastic entropy production to that of observing minus this entropy change in a reverse experiment. The usual second law, stipulating the increase on average of the stochastic entropy production, follows as a subsidiary consequence.},

The argument is based on information-theoretic considerations: we analyze how the accuracy of a clock scales with its size, measured in terms of the number of bits that could be stored in it. We find that a quantum clock can achieve a quadratically improved accuracy compared to a purely classical one of the same size.},

Colloidal organization is the most versatile method used to control nano- and microscale order, and employs either the enthalpy-driven self-assembly of particles at a low concentration or the entropy-driven packing of particles at a high concentration. Nonetheless, it cannot yet provide the spontaneous three-dimensional organization of multicomponent particles at a high concentration. Here we combined these two concepts into a single strategy to achieve hierarchical multicomponent materials. We tuned the electrostatic attraction between polymer and silica nanoparticles to create dynamic supracolloids whose components, on drying, reorganize by entropy into three-dimensional structured materials. Cryogenic electron tomography reveals the kinetic pathways, whereas Monte Carlo simulations combined with a kinetic model provide design rules to form the supracolloids and control the kinetic pathways. This approach may be useful to fabricate hierarchical hybrid materials for distinct technological applications.},

  abstract = {Many intracellular signaling pathways are composed of molecular switches, proteins that transition between two states---on and off. Typically, signaling is initiated when an external stimulus activates its cognate receptor that, in turn, causes downstream switches to transition from off to on using one of the following mechanisms: activation, in which the transition rate from the off state to the on state increases; derepression, in which the transition rate from the on state to the off state decreases; and concerted, in which activation and derepression operate simultaneously. We use mathematical modeling to compare these signaling mechanisms in terms of their dose--response curves, response times, and abilities to process upstream fluctuations. Our analysis elucidates several operating principles for molecular switches. First, activation increases the sensitivity of the pathway, whereas derepression decreases sensitivity. Second, activation generates response times that decrease with signal strength, whereas derepression causes response times to increase with signal strength. These opposing features allow the concerted mechanism to not only show dose--response alignment, but also to decouple the response time from stimulus strength. However, these potentially beneficial properties come at the expense of increased susceptibility to upstream fluctuations. We demonstrate that these operating principles also hold when the models are extended to include additional features, such as receptor removal, kinetic proofreading, and cascades of switches. In total, we show how the architecture of molecular switches govern their response properties. We also discuss the biological implications of our findings.},

It is shown that there are two competing conceptions of what is needed to resolve the puzzle of the thermodynamic asymmetry, which differ with respect to the number of distinct T-asymmetries they take to be manifest in the physical world. On the preferable one-asymmetry conception, the remaining puzzle concerns the ordered distribution of matter in the early universe.

In this article, we start with a brief review of the idea that the ``increase in entropy'' is somehow associated with the direction in which time increases. Then, we examine three different, but equivalent definitions of entropy. We find that none of these definitions indicate any hint of a relationship between entropy and time. We can, therefore, conclude that entropy is a timeless quantity. We also discuss the reasons as to why some scientists went astray in associating entropy with time's arrow. Finally, we shall discuss Boltzmann's H-Theorem, which is viewed by many as a proof of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.},

Maximum entropy allows the interpretation of incomplete and "noisy" data, providing a description of the underlying physical systems. It has found application in both practical and theoretical studies ranging from image enhancement to nuclear physics, and from statistical mechanics to economics. The work explores these applications with specific problems of data analysis taken from the physical sciences. It will interest all physical scientists who deal with data and its interpretation, including statisticians and statistical physicists.},

Noting the great disparity between macroscales and microscales Boltzmann developed a statistical approach which explains the observed macroscopic behavior. In particular it predicts the increase with time of the ``Boltzmann entropy'', SB(X), for ``almost all'' microscopic states X, of a nonequilibrium macroscopic system. The quantitative description of the macroscopic evolution, and ipso facto the compatibility between the macroscopic descriptions and microscopic descriptions, is illustrated by an example: the rigorous derivation of a diffusion equation for the typical macroscopic density profile of a Lorentz gas of independent electrons moving according to Hamiltonian dynamics. The role of low entropy ``initial states'' is emphasized.},

Nature uses predominantly chemical energy stored in thermodynamically activated, but kinetically stable, molecules. These high-energy molecules are exploited for the synthesis of other biomolecules, for the activation of biological machinery such as pumps and motors, and for the maintenance of structural order. Knowledge of how chemical energy is transferred to biochemical processes is essential for the development of artificial systems with life-like processes. Here, we discuss how chemical energy can be used to control the structural organization of organic molecules. Four different strategies have been identified according to a distinguishable physical-organic basis. For each class, one example from biology and one from chemistry are discussed in detail to illustrate the practical implementation of each concept and the distinct opportunities they offer. Specific attention is paid to the discussion of chemically fueled non-equilibrium self-assembly. We discuss the meaning of non-equilibrium self-assembly, its kinetic origin, and strategies to develop synthetic non-equilibrium systems.},

Conveniently, the outcome statistics of projective and positive operator-valued measurements do not depend on the ensemble realization, only on the density matrix. Here, we show how the geometric approach to quantum mechanics tracks ensemble realizations.

The same is true for two-dimensional protein assemblies employed in the formation of vesicles from cellular membranes, which rely on ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes to rapidly disassemble upon completion of the process. Recent observations suggest that the nucleolus, p granules, and other three-dimensional membraneless organelles may also demand dissipation of chemical energy to maintain their fluidity. Cooperative binding plays a crucial role in the dynamics of these higher-dimensional structures, but is absent from classic models of one-dimensional cytoskeletal assembly. In this paper, we present a thermodynamically consistent model of active regeneration with cooperative assembly, and compute the maximum turnover rate and minimum disassembly time as a function of the chemical driving force and the binding energy. We find that these driven structures resemble different equilibrium states above and below the nucleation barrier. In particular, we show that the maximal acceleration under large binding energies unites infinite-temperature local fluctuations with low-temperature nucleation kinetics.},

In this article, we use the stochastic thermodynamics of Markov jump processes to compute the minimum rate at which energy must be supplied and dissipated to maintain an arbitrary nonequilibrium distribution in a given energy landscape. This lower bound depends on two factors: the undriven probability current in the equilibrium state and the distance from thermal equilibrium of the target distribution. By showing the consequences of this result in a few simple examples, we suggest general implications for the required energetic costs of macromolecular repair and cytosolic protein localization.},

We illustrate this decomposition on simple models of noisy logical computations, and then apply it to the analysis of patterns of neural activity in the retina as it responds to complex dynamic visual scenes. We find that neural activity breaks detailed balance even when the visual inputs do not, and that this irreversibility arises primarily from interactions between pairs of neurons.},

We use a mild redox chemical reaction network to simultaneously create and destroy a disulfide-based hydrogelator, leading to transient, dynamic behavior. By closely regulating the reaction kinetics and reagent composition, the macroscopic properties of the active materials are fine-tuned.

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

If the fuel supply is finite, the hydrogel is transient, as competing reactions switch molecular subunits between active and inactive states, drive fiber growth and collapse, and dissipate energy. Because the process is away from equilibrium, the structure and mechanical properties can reflect the history of preparation. As a result, the formation of these active materials is not readily susceptible to a statistical treatment in which the configuration and properties of the molecular building blocks specify the resulting material structure. Here, we illustrate a stochastic--thermodynamic and information--theoretic framework for this purpose and apply it to these self-annihilating materials. Among the possible paths, the framework variationally identifies those that are typical---loosely, the minimum number with the majority of the probability. We derive these paths from computer simulations of experimentally-informed stochastic chemical kinetics and a physical kinetics model for the growth of an active hydrogel. The model reproduces features observed by confocal microscopy, including the fiber length, lifetime, and abundance as well as the observation of fast fiber growth and stochastic fiber collapse. The typical mesoscopic paths we extract are less than 0.23\% of those possible, but they accurately reproduce material properties such as mean fiber length.},

The giant amplification results from the interplay between noise and nonorthogonal eigenvectors of the linear stability matrix, yielding transients that grow with time, and which, when driven by the ever-present intrinsic noise, lead to persistent large amplitude patterns. This mechanism shows that fluctuation-induced Turing patterns are observable, and are not strongly limited by the amplitude of demographic stochasticity nor by the value of the diffusion coefficients.},

  abstract = {Stochastic heat engines are devices that generate work from random thermal motion using a small number of highly fluctuating degrees of freedom. Proposals for such devices have existed for more than a century and include the Maxwell demon and the Feynman ratchet. Only recently have they been demonstrated experimentally, using, e.g., thermal cycles implemented in optical traps. However, recent experimental demonstrations of classical stochastic heat engines are nonautonomous, since they require an external control system that prescribes a heating and cooling cycle and consume more energy than they produce. We present a heat engine consisting of three coupled mechanical resonators (two ribbons and a cantilever) subject to a stochastic drive. The engine uses geometric nonlinearities in the resonating ribbons to autonomously convert a random excitation into a low-entropy, nonpassive oscillation of the cantilever. The engine presents the anomalous heat transport property of negative thermal conductivity, consisting in the ability to passively transfer energy from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir.},

  abstract = {Biological systems exhibit strikingly sophisticated properties, including adaptability, directed motion, regulation, and self-organization. Such systems are often described as being ``nonequilibrium'' or ``out-of-equilibrium'', and it can be instructive to think of them as adopting thermodynamic states that require a constant supply of energy to maintain. Despite their ubiquity, systems that demonstrate these abilities require a remarkably stringent set of chemical requirements to exist. Broadly speaking, they must be (a) capable of consuming some external source of energy that (b) acts as a fuel to do some form of work, (c) all while maintaining highly organized structural features at the nanometer length scale that persist in space and over time. It remains a grand challenge in the field of chemistry to synthesize artificial systems capable of similarly complex nonequilibrium behavior both as a means for greater fundamental understanding and as a way to imbue non-natural structures with dynamic behavior for various applications. Yet an oft-overlooked challenge in this field involves not just the synthesis of nonequilibrium materials but also their characterization. The requirements for measuring nanometer-scale systems of nonequilibrium building blocks with the appropriate temporal and spatial resolution are demanding and have heretofore been largely unavailable to researchers. In this Perspective, we highlight challenges and recent advances in the measurement of dynamic nanoscale systems. We argue that progress in this area is crucial and must occur in parallel to synthetic goals if any meaningful understanding is to occur.},

Driven by advances in aberration correction, STEM now allows the routine imaging of structures with single-digit picometre-level precision for localization of atomic units. This Primer focuses on the opportunities emerging at the interface between STEM and machine learning (ML) methods. We review the primary STEM imaging methods, including structural imaging, electron energy loss spectroscopy and its momentum-resolved modalities and 4D-STEM. We discuss the quantification of STEM structural data as a necessary step towards meaningful ML applications and its analysis in terms of the relevant physics and chemistry. We show examples of the opportunities offered by structural STEM imaging in elucidating the chemistry and physics of complex materials and how the latter connect to first-principles and phase-field models to yield consistent interpretation of generative physics. We present the critical infrastructural needs for the broad adoption of ML methods in the STEM community, including the storage of data and metadata to allow the reproduction of experiments. Finally, we discuss the application of ML to automating experiments and novel scanning modes.},

The intrinsic programmability of this RD system allows us to engineer, for the first time, orthogonal autocatalysts that counterpropagate with minimal interaction.

  abstract = {Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model PaLM. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

  abstract = {This paper surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub "prompt-based learning". Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y{\textbar}x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.the choice of pre-trained models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts, but also release other resources, e.g., a website http://pretrain.nlpedia.ai/ including constantly-updated survey, and paperlist.},

  abstract = {Despite achieving incredibly low perplexities on myriad natural language corpora, today's language models still often underperform when used to generate text. This dichotomy has puzzled the language generation community for the last few years. In this work, we posit that the abstraction of natural language as a communication channel ({\textbackslash}`a la Shannon, 1948) can provide new insights into the behaviors of probabilistic language generators, e.g., why high-probability texts can be dull or repetitive. Humans use language as a means of communicating information, and do so in a simultaneously efficient and error-minimizing manner; they choose each word in a string with this (perhaps subconscious) goal in mind. We propose that generation from probabilistic models should mimic this behavior. Rather than always choosing words from the high-probability region of the distribution--which have a low Shannon information content--we sample from the set of words with information content close to the conditional entropy of our model, i.e., close to the expected information content. This decision criterion can be realized through a simple and efficient implementation, which we call typical sampling. Automatic and human evaluations show that, in comparison to nucleus and top-k sampling, typical sampling offers competitive performance in terms of quality while consistently reducing the number of degenerate repetitions.},

In RD, two or more reactants diffuse from different positions to give rise to spatially defined structures on reaction. We demonstrate that RD can be used to locally control formation and self-assembly of hydrazone molecular gelators from their non-assembling precursors, leading to soft, free-standing hydrogel objects with sizes ranging from several hundred micrometres up to centimeters. Different chemical functionalities and gradients can easily be integrated in the hydrogel objects by using different reactants. Our methodology, together with the vast range of organic reactions and self-assembling building blocks, provides a general approach towards the programmed fabrication of soft microscale objects with controlled functionality and shape.},

  abstract = {Biological molecular motors (or biomolecular motors for short) are nature's solution to the efficient conversion of chemical energy to mechanical movement. In biological systems, these fascinating molecules are responsible for movement of molecules, organelles, cells, and whole animals. In engineered systems, these motors can potentially be used to power actuators and engines, shuttle cargo to sensors, and enable new computing paradigms. Here, we review the progress in the past decade in the integration of biomolecular motors into hybrid nanosystems. After briefly introducing the motor proteins kinesin and myosin and their associated cytoskeletal filaments, we review recent work aiming for the integration of these biomolecular motors into actuators, sensors, and computing devices. In some systems, the creation of mechanical work and the processing of information become intertwined at the molecular scale, creating a fascinating type of ``active matter''. We discuss efforts to optimize biomolecular motor performance, construct new motors combining artificial and biological components, and contrast biomolecular motors with current artificial molecular motors. A recurrent theme in the work of the past decade was the induction and utilization of collective behavior between motile systems powered by biomolecular motors, and we discuss these advances. The exertion of external control over the motile structures powered by biomolecular motors has remained a topic of many studies describing exciting progress. Finally, we review the current limitations and challenges for the construction of hybrid systems powered by biomolecular motors and try to ascertain if there are theoretical performance limits. Engineering with biomolecular motors has the potential to yield commercially viable devices, but it also sharpens our understanding of the design problems solved by evolution in nature. This increased understanding is valuable for synthetic biology and potentially also for medicine.},

We study the problem of model selection in the context of subset selection for high-dimensional linear regressions. Accordingly, we propose a new model selection criterion with the Fisher information that leads to the selection of a parsimonious model from all the combinatorial models up to some maximum level of sparsity. We analyze the performance of our criterion as the number of measurements grows to infinity, as well as when the noise variance tends to zero. In each case, we prove that our proposed criterion gives the true model with a probability approaching one. Additionally, we devise a computationally affordable algorithm to conduct model selection with the proposed criterion in practice. Interestingly, as a side product, our algorithm can provide the ideal regularization parameter for the Lasso estimator such that Lasso selects the true variables. Finally, numerical simulations are included to support our theoretical findings.},

The main challenge in SA research is the ability to ``program'' the properties of the individual pieces such that they organize into a desired structure. Although a general strategy for doing so is still elusive, heuristic rules can be formulated that guide design of SA under various conditions and thermodynamic constraints. This Review examines SA in both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium/dynamic systems and discusses different SA modalities: energy driven, entropy-driven, templated, and field-directed. Non-equilibrium SA is discussed as a route to reconfigurable (``adaptive'') materials, and its connection to biological systems is emphasized.},

While the size and probability of this set are central to information theory and statistical mechanics, they can often only be estimated accurately in the asymptotic limit due to the exponential growth in possible sequences. Here we derive a time-inhomogeneous dynamics that constructs the properties of the typical set for all finite length sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables. These dynamics link the finite properties of the typical set to asymptotic results and allow the typical set to be applied to small and transient systems. The main result is a geometric mapping---the triangle map---relating sequences of random variables of length n to those of length n+1. We show that the number of points in this map needed to quantify the properties of the typical set grows linearly with sequence length, despite the exponential growth in the number of typical sequences. We illustrate the framework for the Bernoulli process and the Schl{\"o}gl model for autocatalytic chemical reactions and demonstrate both the convergence to asymptotic limits and the ability to reproduce exact calculations.},

  abstract = {ConspectusThe ongoing revolution of the natural sciences by the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence sparked significant interest in the material science community in recent years. The intrinsically high dimensionality of the space of realizable materials makes traditional approaches ineffective for large-scale explorations. Modern data science and machine learning tools developed for increasingly complicated problems are an attractive alternative. An imminent climate catastrophe calls for a clean energy transformation by overhauling current technologies within only several years of possible action available. Tackling this crisis requires the development of new materials at an unprecedented pace and scale. For example, organic photovoltaics have the potential to replace existing silicon-based materials to a large extent and open up new fields of application. In recent years, organic light-emitting diodes have emerged as state-of-the-art technology for digital screens and portable devices and are enabling new applications with flexible displays. Reticular frameworks allow the atom-precise synthesis of nanomaterials and promise to revolutionize the field by the potential to realize multifunctional nanoparticles with applications from gas storage, gas separation, and electrochemical energy storage to nanomedicine. In the recent decade, significant advances in all these fields have been facilitated by the comprehensive application of simulation and machine learning for property prediction, property optimization, and chemical space exploration enabled by considerable advances in computing power and algorithmic efficiency.In this Account, we review the most recent contributions of our group in this thriving field of machine learning for material science. We start with a summary of the most important material classes our group has been involved in, focusing on small molecules as organic electronic materials and crystalline materials. Specifically, we highlight the data-driven approaches we employed to speed up discovery and derive material design strategies. Subsequently, our focus lies on the data-driven methodologies our group has developed and employed, elaborating on high-throughput virtual screening, inverse molecular design, Bayesian optimization, and supervised learning. We discuss the general ideas, their working principles, and their use cases with examples of successful implementations in data-driven material discovery and design efforts. Furthermore, we elaborate on potential pitfalls and remaining challenges of these methods. Finally, we provide a brief outlook for the field as we foresee increasing adaptation and implementation of large scale data-driven approaches in material discovery and design campaigns.},

Improved ML models are therefore actively researched, but their design is currently guided mainly by monitoring the average model test error. This can render different models indistinguishable although their performance differs substantially across materials, or it can make a model appear generally insufficient while it actually works well in specific sub-domains. Here, we present a method, based on subgroup discovery, for detecting domains of applicability (DA) of models within a materials class. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by analyzing three state-of-the-art ML models for predicting the formation energy of transparent conducting oxides. We find that, despite having a mutually indistinguishable and unsatisfactory average error, the models have DAs with distinctive features and notably improved performance.},

Specifically, one seeks a set of subregions of the input variable space within which the value of the output variable is considerably larger (or smaller) than its average value over the entire input domain. In addition it is usually desired that these regions be describable in an interpretable form involving simple statements (``rules'') concerning the input values. This paper presents a procedure directed towards this goal based on the notion of ``patient'' rule induction. This patient strategy is contrasted with the greedy ones used by most rule induction methods, and semi-greedy ones used by some partitioning tree techniques such as CART. Applications involving scientific and commercial data bases are presented.},

For shaping this fourth paradigm and contributing to the development or discovery of improved and novel materials, data must be what is now called FAIR -- Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Repurposable/Reusable. This sets the stage for advances of methods from artificial intelligence that operate on large data sets to find trends and patterns that cannot be obtained from individual calculations and not even directly from high-throughput studies.

How such an unstable state could have selected from an abiotic pool of molecules remains a mystery. Here we show that liquid phase-separation offers a mechanism for the selection of dissipative products from a library of reacting molecules. We bring a set of primitive carboxylic acids out-of-equilibrium by addition of high-energy condensing agents. The resulting anhydrides are transiently present before deactivation via hydrolysis. We find the anhydrides that phase-separate into droplets to protect themselves from hydrolysis and to be more persistent than non-assembling ones. Thus, after several starvation-refueling cycles, the library self-selects the phase-separating anhydrides. We observe that the self-selection mechanism is more effective when the library is brought out-of-equilibrium by periodic addition of batches as opposed to feeding it continuously. Our results suggest that phase-separation offers a selection mechanism for energy dissipating assemblies.},

However, electrical energy, one of the most common energy sources, has remained unexplored for such purposes. Here, we demonstrate a new platform for creating active supramolecular materials using electrically fueled dissipative self-assembly. Through an electrochemical redox reaction network, a transient and highly active supramolecular assembly is achieved with rapid kinetics, directionality, and precise spatiotemporal control. As electronic signals are the default information carriers in modern technology, the described approach offers a potential opportunity to integrate active materials into electronic devices for bioelectronic applications.},

Another bound, based on the average energy E, was established by Margolus and Levitin. The bounds coincide and can be attained by certain initial states if {$\Delta$}E=E. Yet, the problem remained open when {$\Delta$}E{$\neq$}E. We consider the unified bound that involves both {$\Delta$}E and E. We prove that there exist no initial states that saturate the bound if {$\Delta$}E{$\neq$}E.

In the original formulation of HSVR, there were no rules for choosing the depth of the model. In this paper, we observe in a number of models a phase transition in the training error---the error remains relatively constant as layers are added, until a critical scale is passed, at which point the training error drops close to zero and remains nearly constant for added layers. We introduce a method to predict this critical scale a priori with the prediction based on the support of either a Fourier transform of the data or the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) spectrum. This allows us to determine the required number of layers prior to training any models.},

The first is the relationship of the spectral properties of the dynamics on the attractor of the original, high-dimensional dynamical system with the properties and possibilities for model reduction. We review some elements of the spectral theory of dynamical systems. We apply this theory to obtain a decomposition of the process that utilizes spectral properties of the linear Koopman operator associated with the asymptotic dynamics on the attractor. This allows us to extract the almost periodic part of the evolving process. The remainder of the process has continuous spectrum. The second topic we discuss is that of model validation, where the original, possibly high-dimensional dynamics and the dynamics of the reduced model -- that can be deterministic or stochastic -- are compared in some norm. Using the ``statistical Takens theorem'' proven in (Mezi{\'c}, I. and Banaszuk, A. Physica D, 2004) we argue that comparison of average energy contained in the finite-dimensional projection is one in the hierarchy of functionals of the field that need to be checked in order to assess the accuracy of the projection.},

Koopman mode decomposition is based on the surprising fact, discovered in Mezi{\'c} (2005), that normal modes of linear oscillations have their natural analogs---Koopman modes---in the context of nonlinear dynamics. To pursue this analogy, one must change the representation of the system from the state-space representation to the dynamics governed by the linear Koopman operator on an infinite-dimensional space of observables. Whereas Koopman in his original paper dealt only with measure-preserving transformations, the discussion here is predominantly on dissipative systems arising from Navier-Stokes evolution. The analysis is based on spectral properties of the Koopman operator. Aspects of point and continuous parts of the spectrum are discussed. The point spectrum corresponds to isolated frequencies of oscillation present in the fluid flow, and also to growth rates of stable and unstable modes. The continuous part of the spectrum corresponds to chaotic motion on the attractor. A method of computation of the spectrum and the associated Koopman modes is discussed in terms of generalized Laplace analysis. When applied to a generic observable, this method uncovers the full point spectrum. A computational alternative is given by Arnoldi-type methods, leading to so-called dynamic mode decomposition, and I discuss the connection and differences between these two methods. A number of applications are reviewed in which decompositions of this type have been pursued. Koopman mode theory unifies and provides a rigorous background for a number of different concepts that have been advanced in fluid mechanics, including global mode analysis, triple decomposition, and dynamic mode decomposition.},

Such datasets are characterized by coherent patterns across both space and time, yet existing computational methods are typically restricted to analysis either in space or in time separately. New method Here we report the adaptation of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), an algorithm originally developed for studying fluid physics, to large-scale neural recordings. DMD is a modal decomposition algorithm that describes high-dimensional dynamic data using coupled spatial--temporal modes. The algorithm is robust to variations in noise and subsampling rate; it scales easily to very large numbers of simultaneously acquired measurements. Results We first validate the DMD approach on sub-dural electrode array recordings from human subjects performing a known motor task. Next, we combine DMD with unsupervised clustering, developing a novel method to extract spindle networks during sleep. We uncovered several distinct sleep spindle networks identifiable by their stereotypical cortical distribution patterns, frequency, and duration. Comparison with existing methods DMD is closely related to principal components analysis (PCA) and discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We may think of DMD as a rotation of the low-dimensional PCA space such that each basis vector has coherent dynamics. Conclusions The resulting analysis combines key features of performing PCA in space and power spectral analysis in time, making it particularly suitable for analyzing large-scale neural recordings.},

We provide a diverse collection of examples from various authors and disciplines in chemistry. While taking into account varying accessibility across research groups, our recommendations focus on reporting completeness and standardizing comparisons between tools. We aim to further contribute to improved ML transparency and credibility by suggesting a checklist of retro-/prospective tests and dissecting their importance.

  abstract = {The total entropy production quantifies the extent of irreversibility in thermodynamic systems, which is nonnegative for any feasible dynamics. When additional information such as the initial and final states or moments of an observable is available, it is known that tighter lower bounds on the entropy production exist according to the classical speed limits and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Here we obtain a universal lower bound on the total entropy production in terms of probability distributions of an observable in the time forward and backward processes. For a particular case, we show that our universal relation reduces to a classical speed limit, imposing a constraint on the speed of the system's evolution in terms of the Hatano-Sasa entropy production. Notably, the obtained classical speed limit is tighter than the previously reported bound by a constant factor. Moreover, we demonstrate that a generalized thermodynamic uncertainty relation can be derived from another particular case of the universal relation. Our uncertainty relation holds for systems with time-reversal symmetry breaking and recovers several existing bounds. Our approach provides a unified perspective on two closely related classes of inequality: classical speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations.},

Microscopic heat engines can exploit thermal as well as active fluctuations to extract thermodynamic work. We investigate the properties of a microscopic Stirling's engine that uses an active (self-propelling) particle as a working substance, in contact with two thermal baths. It is shown that the presence of activity leads to an enhanced performance of the engine. The efficiency can be improved by increasing the activity strength for all cycle time, including the nonquasistatic regime. We verify that the analytical results agree very well with our simulations. The variation of efficiency with the temperature difference between the two thermal baths has also been explored. The optimum region of operation of the engine has been deduced, by using its efficient power (product of efficiency and power) as a quantifier. Finally, a simple model is provided that emulates the behavior of a flywheel driven by this engine.},

Oscillations are often observed in complex biological networks, but oscillating, self-replicating species are unknown, and how to control autonomous supramolecular-level oscillating systems is also not yet established. Here we show how a population of self-assembling self-replicators can autonomously oscillate, so that simple micellar species repeatedly appear and disappear in time. The interplay of molecular and supramolecular events is key to observing oscillations: the repeated formation and disappearance of compartments is connected to a reaction network where molecular-level species are formed and broken down. The dynamic behaviour of our system across different length scales offers the opportunities for mass transport, as we demonstrate via reversible dye uptake. We believe these findings will inspire new biomimetic systems and may unlock nanotechnology systems such as (supra)molecular pumps, where compartment formation is controlled in time and space.},

  abstract = {The inference of thermodynamic quantities from the description of an only partially accessible physical system is a central challenge in stochastic thermodynamics. A common approach is coarse-graining, which maps the dynamics of such a system to a reduced effective one. While coarse-graining states of the system into compound ones is a well studied concept, recent evidence hints at a complementary description by considering observable transitions and waiting times. In this work, we consider waiting time distributions between two consecutive transitions of a partially observable Markov network. We formulate an entropy estimator using their ratios to quantify irreversibility. Depending on the complexity of the underlying network, we formulate criteria to infer whether the entropy estimator recovers the full physical entropy production or whether it just provides a lower bound that improves on established results. This conceptual approach, which is based on the irreversibility of underlying cycles, additionally enables us to derive estimators for the topology of the network, i.e., the presence of a hidden cycle, its number of states and its driving affinity. Adopting an equivalent semi-Markov description, our results can be condensed into a fluctuation theorem for the corresponding semi-Markov process. This mathematical perspective provides a unifying framework for the entropy estimators considered here and established earlier ones. The crucial role of the correct version of time-reversal helps to clarify a recent debate on the meaning of formal versus physical irreversibility. Extensive numerical calculations based on a direct evaluation of waiting-time distributions illustrate our exact results and provide an estimate on the quality of the bounds for affinities of hidden cycles.},

Given time series observations of intra-, inter-, or multicellular processes, a key challenge is to detect nonequilibrium behavior and quantify the rate of free energy consumption. Obtaining reliable bounds on energy consumption and entropy production directly from experimental data remains difficult in practice, as many degrees of freedom typically are hidden to the observer, so that the accessible coarse-grained dynamics may not obviously violate detailed balance. Here, we introduce a novel method for bounding the entropy production of physical and living systems which uses only the waiting time statistics of hidden Markov processes and, hence, can be directly applied to experimental data. By determining a universal limiting curve, we infer entropy production bounds from experimental data for gene regulatory networks, mammalian behavioral dynamics, and numerous other biological processes. Further considering the asymptotic limit of increasingly precise biological timers, we estimate the necessary entropic cost of heartbeat regulation in humans, dogs, and mice.},

  abstract = {It is now clear that fished populations can fluctuate more than unharvested stocks. However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50-year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age-truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels.},

Clear enough, but in the late 1970s, theorists suggested that it also reduces the resilience of fish populations in the face of change. Discussion on the topic has remained theoretical until now: the availability of a 50-year larval fish survey of waters off California, begun when sardine populations there collapsed in the 1940s, provides the data. And it seems that fishing does magnify population variability (reducing resilience) in ways that extend beyond the removals themselves. A truncated age structure, with larger and older fish being removed first, is the likely cause. This suggests that to avoid collapse, fisheries must be managed not only to sustain total biomass, but also to maintain the age structure of a population.},

Are there analogous dynamic scaling laws that are unique to the chemical reaction mechanisms available synthetically and occurring naturally? Here, we formulate two complementary approaches to the dynamic scaling of stochastic fluctuations in thermodynamic observables at and away from equilibrium. Both analytical expressions and numerical simulations confirm our dynamic scaling ans\{{\textbackslash}"a\}tze with their associated exponents, functions, and laws. A survey of common chemical mechanisms reveals classes that organize according to the molecularity of the reactions involved, the nature of the reaction vessel and external reservoirs, (non)equilibrium conditions, and the extent of autocatalysis in the reaction network. Coupled reactions capable of chemical feedback can transition, sometimes sharply, between these classes with the variation of experimental parameters such as temperature. While path observables like the dynamical activity have scaling exponents that are time-independent, fluctuations in the entropy production and flow can have time-dependent scaling exponents and self-averaging properties as a result of temporal correlations that emerge during thermodynamically irreversible processes. Altogether, these results establish dynamic universality in the nonequilibrium fluctuations of thermodynamic observables for well-mixed chemical reactions.},

Recently, this form of movement has been artificially realized through pressure-driven eversion of flexible, thin-walled tubes. Here we review recent work on robots that ``grow'' via pressure-driven eversion, referred to as ``everting vine robots,'' due to a movement pattern that is similar to that of natural vines. We break this work into four categories. First, we examine the design of everting vine robots, highlighting tradeoffs in material selection, actuation methods, and placement of sensors and tools. These tradeoffs have led to application-specific implementations. Second, we describe the state of and need for modeling everting vine robots. Quasi-static models of growth and retraction and kinematic and force-balance models of steering and environment interaction have been developed that use simplifying assumptions and limit the involved degrees of freedom. Third, we report on everting vine robot control and planning techniques that have been developed to move the robot tip to a target, using a variety of modalities to provide reference inputs to the robot. Fourth, we highlight the benefits and challenges of using this paradigm of movement for various applications. Everting vine robot applications to date include deploying and reconfiguring structures, navigating confined spaces, and applying forces on the environment. We conclude by identifying gaps in the state of the art and discussing opportunities for future research to advance everting vine robots and their usefulness in the field.},

As such, soft robots enable various intriguing applications, including human-safe interaction devices, soft active rehabilitation devices, and soft grippers for pick-and-place tasks in industrial environments. In most cases, soft robots use pneumatic actuation to inflate the channels in a compliant material to obtain the movement of the structure. However, due to their flexibility and nonlinear behavior, as well as the compressibility of air, controlled movements of the soft robotic structure are difficult to attain. Obtaining physically-based mathematical models, which would enable the development of suitable control approaches for soft robots, constitutes thus a critical challenge in the field. The aim of this work is, therefore, to predict the movement of a pneumatic soft robot by using a data-driven approach based on the Koopman operator framework. The Koopman operator allows simplifying a nonlinear system by``lifting'' its dynamics into a higher dimensional space, where its behavior can be accurately approximated by a linear model, thus allowing a significant reduction of the complexity of the design of the resulting controllers.},

We demonstrate the validity of our previously conjectured bound on the specific entropy SE in numerous examples taken from quantum mechanics (number of energy levels upto given energy), free-field systems (entropy of miscellaneous radiations for given energy), and strongly interacting particles (number of many-hadron states up to given energy). In the quantum-mechanical examples we have compared the bound directly with the logarithm of the number of levels for the harmonic oscillator, the rigid rotator, and a particle in an arbitrary potential well. For many-particle systems such as radiations, there is no closed formula for the number of configurations associated with a specified one-particle spectrum. To overcome this barrier we use an efficient numerical algorithm to calculate the number of configurations up to given energy from the spectrum. In all our examples of systems of scalar, electromagnetic, and neutrino quanta contained in spaces of various shapes, the numerical results are in harmony with the bound on SE. This conclusion is buttressed by an approximate analytical estimate of the peak SE which leaves little doubt as to the general applicability of the bound for systems of free quanta. We consider a gas of hadrons confined to a cavity as an example of a system of strongly interacting particles. Our numerical algorithm applied to the Hagedorn mass spectrum for hadrons confirms that the number of many-hadron states up to a given energy is consistent with the bound. Finally, we show that a rather general one-channel communication system has an information-carrying capacity which cannot exceed a bound akin to that on SE. It is argued that a complete many-channel system is similarly limited.},

  abstract = {IN abstract dynamics an instantaneous reversal of the motion of every moving particle of a system causes the system to move backwards, each particle of it along its old path,-and at the same speed as before when again in the same position---that is to say, in mathematical language, any solution remains a solution when t is changed into ---t. In physical dynamics, this simple and perfect reversibility fails on account of forces depending on friction of solids; imperfect fluidity of fluids; imperfect elasticity of solids; inequalities of temperature and consequent conduction of beat produced by stresses in solids and fluids; imperfect magnetic retentiveness; residual electric polarisation of dielectrics; generation of heat by electric currents induced by motion; diffusion of fluids, solution of solids in fluids, and other chemical changes; and absorption of radiant heat and light. Consideration of these agencies in connection with the all-pervading law of the conservation of energy proved for them by Joule, led me twenty-three years ago to the theory of the dissipation of energy, which I communicated first to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1852, in a paper entitled ``On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy.},

As it is most certain that Creative Power alone can either call into existence or annihilate mechanical energy, the ``waste'' referred to cannot be annihilation, but must be some transformation of energy.

  abstract = {Living systems operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Enzymatic activity can induce broken detailed balance at the molecular scale. This molecular scale breaking of detailed balance is crucial to achieve biological functions such as high-fidelity transcription and translation, sensing, adaptation, biochemical patterning, and force generation. While biological systems such as motor enzymes violate detailed balance at the molecular scale, it remains unclear how non-equilibrium dynamics manifests at the mesoscale in systems that are driven through the collective activity of many motors. Indeed, in several cellular systems the presence of non-equilibrium dynamics is not always evident at large scales. For example, in the cytoskeleton or in chromosomes one can observe stationary stochastic processes that appear at first glance thermally driven. This raises the question how non-equilibrium fluctuations can be discerned from thermal noise. We discuss approaches that have recently been developed to address this question, including methods based on measuring the extent to which the system violates the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We also review applications of this approach to reconstituted cytoskeletal networks, the cytoplasm of living cells, and cell membranes. Furthermore, we discuss a more recent approach to detect actively driven dynamics, which is based on inferring broken detailed balance. This constitutes a non-invasive method that uses time-lapse microscopy data, and can be applied to a broad range of systems in cells and tissue. We discuss the ideas underlying this method and its application to several examples including flagella, primary cilia, and cytoskeletal networks. Finally, we briefly discuss recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, which offer new perspectives to understand the physics of living systems.},

Whereas biology has already mastered this approach, fully artificial examples have only appeared in the past decade. Here, we map the available literature examples into four distinct regimes depending on their activation/deactivation rates and the equivalents of deactivating fuel. We present increasingly complex mathematical models, first considering only the chemical activation/deactivation rates (i.e., transient activation) and later including the full details of the isodesmic or cooperative supramolecular processes (i.e., transient self-assembly). We finish by showing that sustained oscillations are possible in chemically fueled cooperative supramolecular polymerization and provide mechanistic insights. We hope our models encourage the quantification of activation, deactivation, assembly, and disassembly kinetics in future studies.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that time-variant harvesting may turn damped dynamics to quasi-periodic fluctuations. Exploited populations, e.g. grouse, may therefore fluctuate more than expected if we do not manage to keep the harvest fraction constant over time. However, the harvest fraction of Finnish grouse varies with the phase of the cycle. Such a harvesting strategy could potentially change the periodicity of the fluctuations, as can a threshold harvest strategy where a constant fraction is harvested above a density threshold. The two non-linear harvesting strategies investigated here can modulate the dynamic properties of the population in a way not predicted by linear models. We argue that the behaviour of exploited populations and the role of harvesting can only be understood if we identify and understand the interplay of endogenous and exogenous components of population dynamics.},

Here we show that harvesting reduces the population synchrony scale if it depends more strongly on population fluctuations than the density dependence of the growth rate in the absence of harvesting. We show that constant and proportional harvesting always increases the spatial scale, using a theta-logistic model for density regulation. We also provide exact scaling results under harvesting for the Beverton--Holt and the Ricker stock-recruitment models that are commonly applied, e.g. in fisheries. Our results indicate that harvest in areas with large abundances should be encouraged to avoid increase of the spatial scale of synchrony in the population fluctuations that can lead to unexpected quasi-extinction of populations over large areas. Our results quantify this harvesting impact giving the resulting scales of spatial synchrony of population fluctuations. This emphasizes the importance of estimating the form of density dependence as well as the dependency of harvest upon population density of exploited populations, in order to get reliable predictions of the size of areas that can undergo simultaneous quasi-extinction.},

However, population-dynamic theory predicts that impacts of harvesting depend on the type and strength of density-dependent regulation. Here, we used logistic population growth models and an empirical reindeer case study to show that low to moderate harvesting can actually buffer populations against environmental perturbations. This occurs because of density-dependent environmental stochasticity, where negative environmental impacts on vital rates are amplified at high population density due to intra-specific resource competition. Simulations from our population models show that even low levels of harvesting may prevent overabundance, thereby dampening population fluctuations and reducing the risk of population collapse and quasi-extinction following environmental perturbations. Thus, depending on the species' life history and the strength of density-dependent environmental drivers, low to moderate harvesting can improve population resistance to increased climate variability and extreme weather expected under global warming.},

This possibility has attracted much interest over the last years. Recently, Itano, Heinzen, Bollinger and Wineland have reported that they succeeded in observing the quantum Zeno effect.

There has been much disagreement as to how the quantum Zeno effect should be defined and as to whether it is really a paradox, requiring new physics, or merely a consequence of ``ordinary'' quantum mechanics. The experiment of Itano, Heinzen, Bollinger, and Wineland, published in 1990, has been cited around 347 times and seems to be the one most often called a demonstration of the quantum Zeno effect. Given that there is disagreement as to what the quantum Zeno effect is, there naturally is disagreement as to whether that experiment demonstrated the quantum Zeno effect. Some differing perspectives regarding the quantum Zeno effect and what would constitute an experimental demonstration are discussed.},

Given a discrete-time linear system, an indefinite cost-functional and a linear subspace of the state space, the problem of minimizing the cost-functional over all inputs that force the state trajectory to converge to the given subspace is considered. A geometric characterization of the set of all Hermitian solutions of the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation is given. This characterization forms the discrete-time counterpart of the well-known geometric characterization of the set of all real symmetric solutions of the continuous-time algebraic Riccati equation as developed by Willems [IEEE Trans.

In the set of all Hermitian solutions of the Riccati equation the solution that leads to the optimal cost for the above-mentioned linear quadratic problem is identified. Finally, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal controls are given.}

This opens the door to revisiting foundational questions and issues, such as the nature of quantum entropy, from a geometric perspective. Central to this is the concept of a geometric quantum state---the probability measure on a system's space of pure states. This space's continuity leads us to introduce two analysis tools, inspired by Renyi's approach to information theory of continuous variables, to characterize and quantify fundamental properties of geometric quantum states: the quantum information dimension, which is the rate of geometric quantum state compression, and the dimensional geometric entropy that monitors information stored in quantum states. We recount their classical definitions, information-theoretic interpretations, and adapt them to quantum systems via the geometric approach. We then explicitly compute them in various examples and classes of quantum system. We conclude commenting on future directions for information in geometric quantum mechanics.},

  abstract = {Entropy is one of the few quantities in the physical sciences that require a particular direction for time, sometimes called an arrow of time. As one goes "forward" in time, the second law of thermodynamics says, the entropy of an isolated system can increase, but not decrease. Thus, entropy measurement is a way of distinguishing the past from the future. In thermodynamic systems that are not isolated, entropy can decrease with time, for example living systems where local entropy is reduced at the expense of an environmental increase (resulting in a net increase in entropy), the formation of typical crystals, the workings of a refrigerator and within living organisms. Much like temperature, despite being an abstract concept, everyone has an intuitive sense of the effects of entropy. For example, it is often very easy to tell the difference between a video being played forwards or backwards. A video may depict a wood fire that melts a nearby ice block, played in reverse it would show that a puddle of water turned a cloud of smoke into unburnt wood and froze itself in the process. Surprisingly, in either case the vast majority of the laws of physics are not broken by these processes, a notable exception being the second law of thermodynamics. When a law of physics applies equally when time is reversed, it is said to show T-symmetry; in this case, entropy is what allows one to decide if the video described above is playing forwards or in reverse as intuitively we identify that only when played forwards the entropy of the scene is increasing. Because of the second law of thermodynamics, entropy prevents macroscopic processes showing T-symmetry. When studying at a microscopic scale, the above judgements cannot be made. Watching a single smoke particle buffeted by air, it would not be clear if a video was playing forwards or in reverse, and, in fact, it would not be possible as the laws which apply show T-symmetry. As it drifts left or right, qualitatively it looks no different. It is only when the gas is studied at a macroscopic scale that the effects of entropy become noticeable. On average it would be expected that the smoke particles around a struck match would drift away from each other, diffusing throughout the available space. It would be an astronomically improbable event for all the particles to cluster together, yet the movement of any one smoke particle cannot be predicted. By contrast, certain subatomic interactions involving the weak nuclear force violate the conservation of parity, but only very rarely. According to the CPT theorem, this means they should also be time irreversible, and so establish an arrow of time. This, however, is neither linked to the thermodynamic arrow of time, nor has anything to do with the daily experience of time irreversibility.},

The rearrangement happens on a time scale longer than the typical time scale of diffusion of the particle; as a result, effectively, the diffusion coefficient of the particle varies as a stochastic function of time. What is the probability that the particle will survive within the bounded region, given that it is absorbed the first time it hits the boundary of the region in which it diffuses? This question is of great interest in a variety of chemical and biological problems. If the diffusion coefficient is a constant, then analytical solutions for a variety of cases are available in the literature. However, there is no solution available for the case in which the diffusion coefficient is a random function of time. We discuss a class of models for which it is possible to find analytical solutions to the problem. We illustrate the method for a circular, two-dimensional region, but our methods are easy to apply to diffusion in arbitrary dimensions and spherical/rectangular regions. Our solution shows that if the dimension of the region is large, then only the average value of the diffusion coefficient determines the survival probability. However, for smaller-sized regions, one would be able to see the effects of the stochasticity of the diffusion coefficient. We also give generalizations of the results to N dimensions.},

Here we derive a finite-time TUR valid for arbitrary initial states from the Cram{\'e}r-Rao inequality. We find that the variance of an accumulated current is bounded from below by the instantaneous current at the final time, which suggests that ``the boundary is constrained by the bulk''. We apply our results to feedback-controlled processes and successfully explain a recent experiment which reports a violation of a modified TUR with feedback control. We also derive a TUR that is linear in the total entropy production and valid for discrete-time Markov chains with nonsteady initial states. The obtained bound exponentially improves the existing bounds in a discrete-time regime.},

We also derive a periodic uncertainty principle of which previous known bounds for periodic or stationary Markov chains known in the literature appear as limit cases. From it a novel bound for stationary Markov processes is derived, which surpasses previous known bounds.

However, for over-parameterized models -- where the number of fit parameters is large enough to perfectly fit the training data -- this picture becomes uninformative. Here, we present an alternative geometric interpretation of regression that applies to both under- and over-parameterized models. Unlike the classical picture which takes place in the space of training labels, our new picture resides in the space of input features. This new feature-based perspective provides a natural geometric interpretation of the double-descent phenomenon in the context of bias and variance, explaining why it can occur even in the absence of label noise. Furthermore, we show that adversarial perturbations -- small perturbations to the input features that result in large changes in label values -- are a generic feature of biased models, arising from the underlying geometry. We demonstrate these ideas by analyzing three minimal models for over-parameterized linear least squares regression: without basis functions (input features equal model features) and with linear or nonlinear basis functions (two-layer neural networks with linear or nonlinear activation functions, respectively).},

  abstract = {The bias-variance trade-off is a central concept in supervised learning. In classical statistics, increasing the complexity of a model (e.g., number of parameters) reduces bias but also increases variance. Until recently, it was commonly believed that optimal performance is achieved at intermediate model complexities which strike a balance between bias and variance. Modern deep learning methods flout this dogma, achieving state-of-the-art performance using ``overparameterized models'' where the number of fit parameters is large enough to perfectly fit the training data. As a result, understanding bias and variance in overparameterized models has emerged as a fundamental problem in machine learning. Here, we use methods from statistical physics to derive analytic expressions for bias and variance in two minimal models of overparameterization (linear regression and two-layer neural networks with nonlinear data distributions), allowing us to disentangle properties stemming from the model architecture and random sampling of data. In both models, increasing the number of fit parameters leads to a phase transition where the training error goes to zero and the test error diverges as a result of the variance (while the bias remains finite). Beyond this threshold, the test error of the two-layer neural network decreases due to a monotonic decrease in both the bias and variance as opposed to the classical bias-variance trade-off. We also show that in contrast with classical intuition, overparameterized models can overfit even in the absence of noise and exhibit bias even if the student and teacher models match. We synthesize these results to construct a holistic understanding of generalization error and the bias-variance trade-off in overparameterized models and relate our results to random matrix theory.},

Here, we present results for one of the simplest examples of an overparameterized model: regression with random linear features (i.e. a two-layer neural network with a linear activation function). Using the zero-temperature cavity method, we derive analytic expressions for the training error, test error, bias, and variance. We show that the linear random features model exhibits three phase transitions: two different transitions to an interpolation regime where the training error is zero, along with an additional transition between regimes with large bias and minimal bias. Using random matrix theory, we show how each transition arises due to small nonzero eigenvalues in the Hessian matrix. Finally, we compare and contrast the phase diagram of the random linear features model to the random nonlinear features model and ordinary regression, highlighting the new phase transitions that result from the use of linear basis functions.},

  abstract = {Dynamical systems are considered dissipative when they asymptotically produce a net contraction of volume in phase space, so that V(t) {$\rightarrow$} 0 as , where V(t) is the volume at time t into which the dynamics transforms a nonzero initial volume V0. The trajectories are thereby forced to asymptotically converge toward time-invariant subsets of measure zero, which are typically strange attractors with fractal structure. Since a probability density is a probability per unit volume in phase space, any initially smooth probability density must become singular as , so invariant probability densities do not exist as proper mathematical functions in dissipative systems. For this reason, the statistical behaviour of such systems is generally analysed in terms of invariant probability measures, which remain well defined even when densities do not. The purpose of this paper is to point out that invariant probability densities in dissipative systems can nevertheless be rigorously defined as singular generalised functions which (a) are natural generalisations of the Dirac delta function, (b) are easier to work with than invariant measures, (c) satisfy the same stationary Liouville equation as continuous invariant densities, and (d) can therefore be formally manipulated in the same way. These simplifying features facilitate the analysis of the statistical properties of dissipative dynamical systems, thereby making abstract measure-theoretical theories of such systems more accessible to students and nonspecialists.},

We introduce a decomposition of an arbitrary current into excess and housekeeping parts, which provide lower bounds on the respective entropy production. Furthermore, we also provide a geometric interpretation of the decomposition, and show that the uncertainties of the two components are not independent, but rather have to obey a joint uncertainty relation, which also yields a tighter bound on the total entropy production. We apply our results to a paradigmatic example that illustrates the physical interpretation of the components of the current and how to estimate the entropy production.},

Most existing theoretical treatments of diffusive instabilities are based on mean-field approaches, such as the use of reaction--diffusion equations, that neglect the role of fluctuations. Here we show that finite fluctuations in particle number can be essential for such an instability to occur. We study, both analytically and with computer simulations, the planar interface separating different species in the simple two-component reaction A+ B {$\rightarrow$} 2A (which can also serve as a simple model of bacterial growth in the presence of a nutrient). The interface displays markedly different dynamics within the reaction--diffusion treatment from that when fluctuations are taken into account. Our findings suggest that fluctuations can provide a new and general pattern-forming mechanism in non-equilibrium growth.},

If a computer could learn to solve the problems through trial and error, that would be of great practical value.

  abstract = {Achieving sustainable harvesting of natural populations depends on our ability to predict population responses to the combined effects of harvesting and environmental fluctuations while accounting for other internal and external factors that influence population dynamics in time and space. Here, we review recent research showing how spatial patterns and interspecific interactions can influence population responses to harvesting in fluctuating environments. We highlight several pathways through which harvesting can, often inadvertently, influence the dynamics and resilience to environmental fluctuations of both harvested and surrounding non-harvested populations and species. For instance, spatial models have shown that harvesting is expected to influence the spatial synchrony of population fluctuations, both of the harvested species and its competitors, predators and prey, with implications for population extinction risk. Dispersal and interspecific interactions can cause responses to harvesting in areas and species that are not themselves harvested. Harvesting that selectively targets certain groups of individuals, either intentionally or through for example spatially biased harvesting, can amplify environmentally induced population fluctuations by biasing the population structure towards individuals that are more sensitive to environmental variation. On the other hand, harvesting can in some cases buffer populations against the density-dependent effects of harsh climatic conditions, which are probably more common than previously acknowledged. Recent advances in modeling are providing new predictions that are highly relevant under global warming and now need to be tested empirically. We discuss how knowledge of these pathways can be used to increase the sustainability of harvesting.},

  abstract = {Living systems operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Enzymatic activity can induce broken detailed balance at the molecular scale. This molecular scale breaking of detailed balance is crucial to achieve biological functions such as high-fidelity transcription and translation, sensing, adaptation, biochemical patterning, and force generation. While biological systems such as motor enzymes violate detailed balance at the molecular scale, it remains unclear how non-equilibrium dynamics manifests at the mesoscale in systems that are driven through the collective activity of many motors. Indeed, in several cellular systems the presence of non-equilibrium dynamics is not always evident at large scales. For example, in the cytoskeleton or in chromosomes one can observe stationary stochastic processes that appear at first glance thermally driven. This raises the question how non-equilibrium fluctuations can be discerned from thermal noise. We discuss approaches that have recently been developed to address this question, including methods based on measuring the extent to which the system violates the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We also review applications of this approach to reconstituted cytoskeletal networks, the cytoplasm of living cells, and cell membranes. Furthermore, we discuss a more recent approach to detect actively driven dynamics, which is based on inferring broken detailed balance. This constitutes a non-invasive method that uses time-lapse microscopy data, and can be applied to a broad range of systems in cells and tissue. We discuss the ideas underlying this method and its application to several examples including flagella, primary cilia, and cytoskeletal networks. Finally, we briefly discuss recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, which offer new perspectives to understand the physics of living systems.},

  abstract = {The Onsager's reciprocal relation plays a fundamental role in the nonequilibrium thermodynamics. However, unfortunately, its classical version is valid only within a narrow region near equilibrium due to the linear regression hypothesis, which largely restricts its usage. In this paper, based on the conservation-dissipation formalism, a generalized version of Onsager's relations for the master equations and Fokker-Planck equations was derived. Nonlinear constitutive relations with nonsymmetric and positively stable operators, which become symmetric under the detailed balance condition, constitute key features of this new generalization. Similar conclusions also hold for many other classical models in physics and chemistry, which in turn make the current study as a benchmark for the application of generalized Onsager's relations in nonequilibrium thermodynamics.},

This fundamental principle provides a very powerful tool for formulating thermodynamically consistent models. It can also be employed to find approximate solutions, especially in the study of soft matter dynamics. In this work, OVP is extended and applied to the dynamic modeling of active soft matter such as suspensions of bacteria and aggregates of animal cells. We first extend the general formulation of OVP to active matter dynamics where active forces are included as external non-conservative forces. We then use OVP to analyze the directional motion of individual active units: a molecular motor walking on a stiff biofilament and a toy two-sphere microswimmer. Next we use OVP to formulate a diffuse-interface model for an active polar droplet on a solid substrate. In addition to the generalized hydrodynamic equations for active polar fluids in the bulk region, we have also derived thermodynamically consistent boundary conditions. Finally, we consider the dynamics of a thin active polar droplet under the lubrication approximation. We use OVP to derive a generalized thin film equation and then employ OVP as an approximation tool to find the spreading laws for the thin active polar droplet. By incorporating the activity of biological systems into OVP, we develop a general approach to construct thermodynamically consistent models for better understanding the emergent behaviors of individual animal cells and cell aggregates or tissues.},

While vanishing QSL times often indicate emergent classical behavior, it is still not entirely understood what precise aspects of classicality are at the origin of this dynamical feature. Here, we show that vanishing QSL times (or, equivalently, diverging quantum speeds) can be traced back to reduced uncertainty in quantum observables and can thus be understood as a consequence of emerging classicality for these particular observables. We illustrate this mechanism by developing a QSL formalism for continuous-variable quantum systems undergoing general Gaussian dynamics. For these systems, we show that three typical scenarios leading to vanishing QSL times, namely large squeezing, small effective Planck's constant, and large particle number, can be fundamentally connected to each other. In contrast, by studying the dynamics of open quantum systems and mixed states, we show that the classicality that emerges due to incoherent mixing of states from the addition of classical noise typically increases the QSL time.},

One of such advances consists in the interpretation of the time-energy uncertainty relations as lower bounds for the minimal evolution time between two distinguishable states of a quantum system, also known as quantum speed limits. We investigate how the nonuniqueness of a bona fide measure of distinguishability defined on the quantum-state space affects the quantum speed limits and can be exploited in order to derive improved bounds. Specifically, we establish an infinite family of quantum speed limits valid for unitary and nonunitary evolutions, based on an elegant information geometric formalism. Our work unifies and generalizes existing results on quantum speed limits and provides instances of novel bounds that are tighter than any established one based on the conventional quantum Fisher information. We illustrate our findings with relevant examples, demonstrating the importance of choosing different information metrics for open system dynamics, as well as clarifying the roles of classical populations versus quantum coherences, in the determination and saturation of the speed limits. Our results can find applications in the optimization and control of quantum technologies such as quantum computation and metrology, and might provide new insights in fundamental investigations of quantum thermodynamics.},

As the interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and a reference work offering a broad selection of topics has become apparent, and this book aims to meet that need. This book will be welcomed as an undergraduate or graduate textbook for students studying matrix analysis. The authors assume a background in elementary linear algebra and knowledge of rudimentary analytical concepts. They begin with a review and discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The following chapters each treat a major topic in depth.

That is, knowledge of a system's stability properties can mislead one's intuition for its transient behaviors. This insight, which has an interesting history in fluid dynamics, has more recently been rediscovered in ecology. Surprisingly, many nonlinear fluid dynamical and ecological systems share linear features associated with transient amplification of noise. This paper aims to establish that these features are widespread in many other disciplines concerned with noisy systems, especially chemistry, cell biology and molecular biology. Here, using classic nonlinear systems and the graphical language of network science, we explore how the noise amplification problem can be reframed in terms of activatory and inhibitory interactions between dynamical variables. The interaction patterns considered here are found in a great variety of systems, ranging from autocatalytic reactions and activator--inhibitor systems to influential models of nerve conduction, glycolysis, cell signaling and circadian rhythms.},

The propagation of random fluctuations through these networks can significantly impact cell behavior, raising challenging questions about how network design shapes the cell's ability to suppress or exploit these fluctuations. Here, drawing on insights from statistical physics, fluid dynamics, and systems biology, we explore how transient amplification phenomena arising from network connectivity naturally limit a biochemical system's ability to suppress small fluctuations around steady-state behaviors. We find that even a simple system consisting of two variables linked by a single interaction is capable of amplifying small fluctuations orders of magnitude beyond the levels predicted by linear stability theory. We also find that adding additional interactions can promote further amplification, even when these interactions implement classic design strategies known to suppress fluctuations. These results establish that transient amplification is an essential factor determining baseline noise levels in stable intracellular networks. Significantly, our analysis is not bound to specific systems or interaction mechanisms: we find that noise amplification is an emergent phenomenon found near steady states in any network containing sufficiently strong interactions, regardless of its form or function.},

Here we show that finite fluctuations in particle number can be essential for such an instability to occur. We study, both analytically and with computer simulations, the planar interface separating different species in the simple two-component reaction A+ B {$\rightarrow$} 2A (which can also serve as a simple model of bacterial growth in the presence of a nutrient). The interface displays markedly different dynamics within the reaction--diffusion treatment from that when fluctuations are taken into account. Our findings suggest that fluctuations can provide a new and general pattern-forming mechanism in non-equilibrium growth.},

  abstract = {We study the collision of two spin-polarized Fermi clouds in a harmonic trap using a simulation of the Boltzmann equation. As observed in recent experiments, we find three distinct regimes of behavior. For weak interactions the clouds pass through each other. If interactions are increased they approach each other exponentially and for strong interactions they bounce off each other several times. We thereby demonstrate that all these phenomena can be reproduced using a semiclassical collisional approach and that these changes in behavior are associated with an increasing collision rate. We then show that the oscillation of the clouds in the bounce regime is an example of an unusual case in quantum gases: a nonlinear coupling between collective modes, namely, the spin dipole mode and the axial breathing mode, which is enforced by collisions. We also determine the frequency of the bounce as a function of the final temperature of the equilibrated system.},

  abstract = {We analyze several puzzling features of a recent experiment with a noninteracting gas of atoms in a quadrupole trap. After an initial momentum kick, the system reaches a stationary, quasithermal state even without collisions, due to the dephasing of individual particle trajectories. Surprisingly, the momentum distribution remains anisotropic at long times, characterized by different temperatures along the different directions. In particular, there is no transfer of the kick energy between the axial and radial trap directions. To understand these effects we discuss and solve two closely related models: a spherically symmetric trap V(r){$\simeq$}r{$\alpha$} and a strongly confined gas along one direction (a pancake trap). We find that in the isotropic trap, the gas unexpectedly also preserves the anisotropy of the kick at long times, which we are able to explain using the conservation of angular momentum and the virial theorem. Depending on the value of {$\alpha$} we find that the kick can cool or heat the orthogonal directions. The pancake trap case is quantitatively similar to the quadrupole one. We show that for the former, the temperature anisotropy and memory of the kick direction are due to the change in the two-dimensional effective potential resulting from the kick, thereby also explaining the quadrupole experimental results.},

Any computation involves modeling---even if often this step is not made explicit---and any model has to neglect details while still being physically accurate. Equilibrium statistical mechanics guides both the development of models and numerical methods for dynamics obeying detailed balance. For systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, such a universal theoretical framework is missing. For a restricted class of driven systems governed by Markov dynamics and local detailed balance, stochastic thermodynamics has evolved to fill this gap and to provide fundamental constraints and guiding principles. The next step is to advance stochastic thermodynamics from simple model systems to complex systems with tens of thousands or even millions of degrees of freedom. Biomolecules operating in the presence of chemical gradients and mechanical forces are a prime example for this challenge. In this Perspective, we give an introduction to isothermal stochastic thermodynamics geared toward the systematic multiscale modeling of the conformational dynamics of biomolecular and synthetic machines, and we outline some of the open challenges.},

If new reactions can be considered unpredictable using current chemical knowledge, then we suggest that they are not merely new but also novel. Such a classification, however, requires an expert judge to have access to all current chemical knowledge or risks a lack of information being interpreted as unpredictability. Here, we describe how searching chemical space using automation and algorithms improves the probability of discovery. The former enables routine chemical tasks to be performed more quickly and consistently, while the latter uses algorithms to facilitate the searching of chemical knowledge databases. Experimental systems can also be developed to discover novel molecules, reactions and mechanisms by augmenting the intuition of the human expert. In order to find new chemical laws, we must seek to question current assumptions and biases. Accomplishing that involves using two areas of algorithmic approaches: algorithms to perform searches, and more general machine learning and statistical modelling algorithms to predict the chemistry under investigation. We propose that such a chemical intelligence approach is already being used and that, in the not-too-distant future, the automated chemical reactor systems controlled by these algorithms and monitored by a sensor array will be capable of navigating and searching chemical space more quickly, efficiently and, importantly, without bias. This approach promises to yield not only new molecules but also unpredictable and thus novel reactivity.},

This approach, in which an agent interacts with an environment to learn which actions it should take to maximise a long-term objective, is particularly suited to problems of planning or sequential decision making. In this review, we present an accessible summary of the theory behind reinforcement learning (and its common extension, deep reinforcement learning) tailored specifically to chemistry researchers. We also review the applications of reinforcement learning which already exist within the world of chemistry, and consider the future direction of research based on this promising technique.},

  abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam's razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.},

Over the past decade, an increasing number of synthetic chemically driven systems have been reported that mimic the features of their natural counterparts. At the same time, it has been shown that dissipative self-assembly can also be fueled by light; these optically fueled systems have been developed in parallel to the chemically fueled ones. In this perspective, we critically compare these two classes of systems. Despite the complementarity and fundamental differences between these two modes of dissipative self-assembly, our analysis reveals that multiple analogies exist between chemically and light-fueled systems. We hope that these considerations will facilitate further development of the field of dissipative self-assembly.},

Here we show man-made equivalents of materials driven by the consumption of high-energy molecules and explore their unique properties. A chemical reaction network converts dicarboxylates into metastable anhydrides driven by the irreversible consumption of carbodiimide fuels. The anhydrides hydrolyse rapidly to the original dicarboxylates and are designed to assemble into hydrophobic colloids, hydrogels or inks. The spatiotemporal control over the formation and degradation of materials allows for the development of colloids that release hydrophobic contents in a predictable fashion, temporary self-erasing inks and transient hydrogels. Moreover, we show that each material can be re-used for several cycles.},

This feature not only inspires dissipative dynamic functionalities in synthetic systems but also poses great challenges in designing novel pathways. Here we report feedback-controlled systems comprising two coupled hydrogels driven by constant light, where the system can be tuned to undergo stable homeostatic self-oscillations or damped steady states of temperature. We demonstrate that stable temperature oscillations can be utilized for dynamic colours and cargo transport, whereas damped steady states enable signal transduction pathways. Here mechanical triggers cause temperature changes that lead to responses such as bending motions inspired by the single-touch mechanoresponse in Mimosa pudica and the frequency-gated snapping motion inspired by the plant arithmetic in the Venus flytrap. The proposed concepts suggest generalizable feedback pathways for dissipative dynamic materials and interactive soft robotics.},

Knowledge of how chemical energy is transferred to biochemical processes is essential for the development of artificial systems with life-like processes. Here, we discuss how chemical energy can be used to control the structural organization of organic molecules. Four different strategies have been identified according to a distinguishable physical-organic basis.

Herein, recent progress in developing diverse synthetic dissipative self-assembly systems is discussed. The systems reported thus far can be categorized into three classes, in which: i) the fuel chemically modifies the building blocks, thus triggering their self-assembly, ii) the fuel acts as a template interacting with the building blocks noncovalently, and iii) transient states are induced by the addition of two mutually exclusive stimuli.

Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods and they produce more accurate predictions.

Such systems are often described as being ``nonequilibrium'' or ``out-of-equilibrium'', and it can be instructive to think of them as adopting thermodynamic states that require a constant supply of energy to maintain. Despite their ubiquity, systems that demonstrate these abilities require a remarkably stringent set of chemical requirements to exist. Broadly speaking, they must be (a) capable of consuming some external source of energy that (b) acts as a fuel to do some form of work, (c) all while maintaining highly organized structural features at the nanometer length scale that persist in space and over time. It remains a grand challenge in the field of chemistry to synthesize artificial systems capable of similarly complex nonequilibrium behavior both as a means for greater fundamental understanding and as a way to imbue non-natural structures with dynamic behavior for various applications. Yet an oft-overlooked challenge in this field involves not just the synthesis of nonequilibrium materials but also their characterization. The requirements for measuring nanometer-scale systems of nonequilibrium building blocks with the appropriate temporal and spatial resolution are demanding and have heretofore been largely unavailable to researchers. In this Perspective, we highlight challenges and recent advances in the measurement of dynamic nanoscale systems. We argue that progress in this area is crucial and must occur in parallel to synthetic goals if any meaningful understanding is to occur.},

  abstract = {Background There is a broad need in neuroscience to understand and visualize large-scale recordings of neural activity, big data acquired by tens or hundreds of electrodes recording dynamic brain activity over minutes to hours. Such datasets are characterized by coherent patterns across both space and time, yet existing computational methods are typically restricted to analysis either in space or in time separately. New method Here we report the adaptation of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), an algorithm originally developed for studying fluid physics, to large-scale neural recordings. DMD is a modal decomposition algorithm that describes high-dimensional dynamic data using coupled spatial--temporal modes. The algorithm is robust to variations in noise and subsampling rate; it scales easily to very large numbers of simultaneously acquired measurements. Results We first validate the DMD approach on sub-dural electrode array recordings from human subjects performing a known motor task. Next, we combine DMD with unsupervised clustering, developing a novel method to extract spindle networks during sleep. We uncovered several distinct sleep spindle networks identifiable by their stereotypical cortical distribution patterns, frequency, and duration. Comparison with existing methods DMD is closely related to principal components analysis (PCA) and discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We may think of DMD as a rotation of the low-dimensional PCA space such that each basis vector has coherent dynamics. Conclusions The resulting analysis combines key features of performing PCA in space and power spectral analysis in time, making it particularly suitable for analyzing large-scale neural recordings.},

Only then can data be readily shared and explored using data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) methods.

Two of the main challenges remaining in DMD research are noise sensitivity and issues related to Krylov space closure when modelling nonlinear systems. Here, we investigate the combination of noise and nonlinearity in a controlled setting, by studying a class of systems with linear latent dynamics which are observed via multinomial observables. Our numerical models include system and measurement noise. We explore the influences of dataset metrics, the spectrum of the latent dynamics, the normality of the system matrix and the geometry of the dynamics. Our results show that even for these very mildly nonlinear conditions, DMD methods often fail to recover the spectrum and can have poor predictive ability. Our work is motivated by our experience modelling multilegged robot data, where we have encountered great difficulty in reconstructing time series for oscillatory systems with intermediate transients, which decay only slightly faster than a period.},

However, quantitative extraction of physical and chemical parameters from the liquid-phase TEM videos remains bottlenecked by the lack of automated analysis methods compatible with the videos' high noisiness and spatial heterogeneity. Here, we integrate, for the first time, liquid-phase TEM imaging with our customized analysis framework based on a machine learning model called U-Net neural network. This combination is made possible by our workflow to generate simulated TEM images as the training data with well-defined ground truth. We apply this framework to three typical systems of colloidal nanoparticles, concerning their diffusion and interaction, reaction kinetics, and assembly dynamics, all resolved in real-time and real-space by liquid-phase TEM. A diversity of properties for differently shaped anisotropic nanoparticles are mapped, including the anisotropic interaction landscape of nanoprisms, curvature-dependent and staged etching profiles of nanorods, and an unexpected kinetic law of first-order chaining assembly of concave nanocubes. These systems representing properties at the nanoscale are otherwise experimentally inaccessible. Compared to the prevalent image segmentation methods, U-Net shows a superior capability to predict the position and shape boundary of nanoparticles from highly noisy and fluctuating background---a challenge common and sometimes inevitable in liquid-phase TEM videos. We expect our framework to push the potency of liquid-phase TEM to its full quantitative level and to shed insights, in high-throughput and statistically significant fashion, on the nanoscale dynamics of synthetic and biological nanomaterials.},

This progress has been accompanied by an exponential increase in the size and quality of data sets produced by microscopic and spectroscopic experimental techniques. These developments necessitate adequate methods for extracting relevant physical and chemical information from the large data sets, for which a priori information on the structures of various atomic configurations and lattice defects is limited or absent. Here we demonstrate an application of deep neural networks to extract information from atomically resolved images including location of the atomic species and type of defects. We develop a ``weakly supervised'' approach that uses information on the coordinates of all atomic species in the image, extracted via a deep neural network, to identify a rich variety of defects that are not part of an initial training set. We further apply our approach to interpret complex atomic and defect transformation, including switching between different coordination of silicon dopants in graphene as a function of time, formation of peculiar silicon dimer with mixed 3-fold and 4-fold coordination, and the motion of molecular ``rotor''. This deep learning-based approach resembles logic of a human operator, but can be scaled leading to significant shift in the way of extracting and analyzing information from raw experimental data.},

In addition, the number of TEM measurements and the average number of nanoparticles in each TEM image should be considered to ensure a satisfactory representation of nanoparticles using TEM images.

To offer an insightful visual representation of kinetic asymmetry, we extended an approach pertaining to catalytic networks, the energy span model, by focusing on system dynamics -- rather than thermodynamics. Our approach encompasses both chemically and photochemically driven systems, ranging from unimolecular motors to simple self-assembly schemes.

  abstract = {Liquid phase electron microscopy (LP-EM) is a rapidly developing method for imaging chemical processes in solution. A key strength of this method is that the high energy electrons can be used as both an energy and illumination source. This enables simultaneous control of the chemistry with nanoscale structural characterization. As electron beams are widely used in the manufacturing of polymeric materials, we believe that the knowledge obtained from LP-EM can directly guide industrial electron beam technologies, enabling the design, optimization, and manufacturing of nanostructured polymeric materials. In this Perspective, we outline the advances made in electron beam synthesis of polymeric materials and discuss the challenges and opportunities for utilizing LP-EM in conjunction with electron beam manufacturing technologies.}

The computation of orthogonal Gram--Schmidt vectors requires multiplication and QR decomposition of large matrices, which grow as N2 (with the particle count). This expense has limited such calculations to relatively small systems and short time scales. Here, we detail two implementations of an algorithm for computing Gram--Schmidt vectors. The first is a distributed-memory message-passing method using Scalapack. The second uses the newly-released MAGMA library for GPUs. We compare the performance of both codes for Lennard--Jones fluids from N=100 to 1300 between Intel Nahalem/Infiniband DDR and NVIDIA C2050 architectures. To our best knowledge, these are the largest systems for which the Gram--Schmidt Lyapunov vectors have been computed, and the first time their calculation has been GPU-accelerated. We conclude that Lyapunov vector calculations can be significantly extended in length and time by leveraging the power of GPU-accelerated linear algebra.},

Here, we derive a classical uncertainty relation that sets a speed limit on the rates of local observables underlying these behaviors. For systems with a time-invariant stability matrix, the speed limit we derive simplifies to a classical analog of the Mandelstam-Tamm versions of the time-energy uncertainty relation. These classical bounds are set by fluctuations in the local stability of state space. To measure these fluctuations, we introduce a definition of the Fisher information in terms of Lyapunov vectors in tangent space, analogous to the quantum Fisher information defined in terms of wave vectors in Hilbert space. This information sets an upper bound on the speed at which classical dynamical systems and their observables, instantaneous Lyapunov exponents and dissipation, evolve. This speed limit applies to systems that are open or closed, conservative or dissipative, actively driven or passively evolving, and directly connects the geometries of phase space and information.},

The canonical implementation of NumPy used by most programmers runs on a single CPU core and is parallelized to use multiple cores for some operations. This restriction to a single-node CPU-only execution limits both the size of data that can be handled and the potential speed of NumPy code. In this work we introduce Legate, a drop-in replacement for NumPy that requires only a single-line code change and can scale up to an arbitrary number of GPU accelerated nodes. Legate works by translating NumPy programs to the Legion programming model and then leverages the scalability of the Legion runtime system to distribute data and computations across an arbitrary sized machine. Compared to similar programs written in the distributed Dask array library in Python, Legate achieves speed-ups of up to 10X on 1280 CPUs and 100X on 256 GPUs.},

  abstract = {Turbidity of water due to the presence of suspended sediment is measured and interpreted in a variety of ways, which can lead to the misinterpretation of data. This paper re-examines the physics of light scattering in water, and exposes the extent to which the reporting of turbidity data is inconsistent. It is proposed that the cause of this inconsistency is the fact that the accepted turbidity standards USEPA Method 180.1, ISO 7027 and GLI Method 2 are mutually inconsistent, as these standards give rise to a large number of measurement units that are not based on the optical properties of light absorption and scattering by suspensions in water, but by the arbitrary definition of the degree of turbidity being due to a concentration of formazin or other similar polymer-based calibration standard. It is then proposed that all turbidity-measuring devices should be calibrated with precise optical attenuators such as neutral density filters. Such calibration would allow for the definition of a beam attenuation coefficient for every turbidity-measuring instrument which would be cross-comparable with any other instrument calibrated in the same way. The units for turbidity measurements should be based on attenuation and reported as dB m?1. It is also proposed that a new standard should be drafted according to this attenuation-based method, and this new standard should also define the nomenclature for reporting data collected at any specific scattering angle in terms of an attenuation in dB m?1. The importance of multi-parameter turbidity measurements for the improvement of the quality of turbidity data and the application of parameter-rich data sets to new methods of sediment characterization are discussed. It is suggested that more research into multi-parameter turbidity measurements is needed, as these new methods will facilitate an increase in parity between turbidity and suspended sediment concentration, a relationship that is subjective.},

Cationic and anionic latexes of similar particle sizes (361 and 370 nm) and different surface charge densities (+16.4 and -3.6 {\textmu}C/cm2) were used throughout. The kinetic constants which control the aggregation processes when the electrical repulsion disappears were estimated by both techniques at different particle concentration and wavelength in order to establish the experimental conditions which provided reliable and similar values for the coagulation rate constant. Both experimental techniques (turbidity and nephelometry) and two ways of fitting the data have been used with both latexes. For the first method, the initial slope of turbidity or total scattered intensity versus time curves were used to calculate the kinetic constants. In the second method, the whole turbidity or total scattered intensity versus time curves were fitted and the kinetic constants calculated. An unambiguous experimental value for the doublet rate constant in diffusion conditions is obtained by turbidity and nephelometry techniques. By nephelometry both data treatments have permitted a distinction between the doublet rate constant and the global rate constant in diffusion conditions.},

Here, we demonstrate a new platform for creating active supramolecular materials using electrically fueled dissipative self-assembly. Through an electrochemical redox reaction network, a transient and highly active supramolecular assembly is achieved with rapid kinetics, directionality, and precise spatiotemporal control. As electronic signals are the default information carriers in modern technology, the described approach offers a potential opportunity to integrate active materials into electronic devices for bioelectronic applications.},

  abstract = {Understanding life is arguably among the most complex scientific problems faced in modern research. From a physics perspective, living systems are complex dynamic entities that operate far from thermo-dynamic equilibrium.1--3 This active, non-equilibrium behaviour, with its constant hunger for energy, allows life to overcome the ever dispersing forces of entropy, and hence drives cellular organisation and dynamics at the micrometer scale.4,5 Unfortunately, most analysis methods provided by the powerful toolbox of statistical mechanics cannot be used in such non-equilibrium situations, forcing researchers to use sophisticated and often invasive approaches to study the mechanistic processes inside living organisms. Here we introduce a new observable coined the mean back relaxation, that allows simple detection of broken detailed balance and full quantification of the active mechanics from passively observed particle trajectories. Based on three-point probabilities and exploiting Onsager's regression hypothesis, the mean back relaxation extracts more information from passively measurements compared to classical observables such as the mean squared displacement. We show that it gives access to the non-equilibrium generating energy and the viscoelastic material properties of a well controlled artificial system, and, surprisingly, also of a variety of living systems. It thus acts as a new marker of non-equilibrium dynamics, a statement based on an astonishing relation between the mean back relaxation and the active mechanical energy. Combining, in a next step, passive fluctuations with the extracted active energy allows to overcome a fundamental barrier in the study of living systems; it gives access to the viscoelastic material properties from passive measurements.},

Deactivation of the molecule either in solution or inside the polymer leads to disassembly. Whereas biology has already mastered this approach, fully artificial examples have only appeared in the past decade. Here, we map the available literature examples into four distinct regimes depending on their activation/deactivation rates and the equivalents of deactivating fuel. We present increasingly complex mathematical models, first considering only the chemical activation/deactivation rates (i.e., transient activation) and later including the full details of the isodesmic or cooperative supramolecular processes (i.e., transient self-assembly). We finish by showing that sustained oscillations are possible in chemically fueled cooperative supramolecular polymerization and provide mechanistic insights. We hope our models encourage the quantification of activation, deactivation, assembly, and disassembly kinetics in future studies.}

Here, we demonstrate a fully electrically fueled (e-fueled) active self-assembly material that can overcome the aforementioned limitations. Using an electrochemical setup with dual electrocatalysts, the anodic oxidation of one electrocatalyst (ferrocyanide, [Fe(CN)6]4--) creates a positive fuel to activate the self-assembly, while simultaneously, the cathodic reduction of the other electrocatalyst (methyl viologen, [MV]2+) generates a negative fuel triggering fiber disassembly. Due to the fully catalytic nature for the reaction networks, this fully e-fueled active material system does not generate any chemical waste, can sustain active behavior for an extended period when the electrical potential is maintained, and provides spatiotemporal control.},

Such out of equilibrium processes are at the heart of all living organisms, and in the past decade, researchers have attempted to transpose these principles to purely synthetic systems. However, upon fuel decomposition, the resulting waste generated tends to accumulate in the system, rapidly inhibiting the machinery after a few cycles of fuel pulses. In order to solve this issue, trichloroacetic acid has appeared as a fuel of choice to reversibly change the acidity of a system, liberating volatile chloroform and CO2 upon fuel decomposition. In this Perspective, we present the advantages of this fuel and successful applications ranging from conformational switches to rotary motors to temporal control over crystallization or smart materials.},

Randomized algorithms are emerging techniques to compute low-rank matrix approximations at a fraction of the cost of deterministic algorithms, easing the computational challenges arising in the area of ``big data.'' The idea is to derive a small matrix from the high-dimensional data, which is then used to efficiently compute the dynamic modes and eigenvalues. The algorithm is presented in a modular probabilistic framework, and the approximation quality can be controlled via oversampling and power iterations. The effectiveness of the resulting randomized DMD  algorithm is demonstrated on several benchmark examples of increasing complexity, providing an accurate and efficient approach to extract spatiotemporal coherent structures from big data in a framework that scales with the intrinsic rank of the data, rather than the ambient measurement dimension. For this work we assume that the dynamics of the problem under consideration is evolving on a low-dimensional subspace that is well characterized by a quickly decaying singular value spectrum.},

  abstract = {The use of dissipative self-assembly driven by chemical reaction networks for the creation of unique structures is gaining in popularity. In dissipative self-assembly, precursors are converted into self-assembling building blocks by the conversion of a source of energy, typically a photon or a fuel molecule. The self-assembling building block is intrinsically unstable and spontaneously reverts to its original precursor, thus giving the building block a limited lifetime. As a result, its presence is kinetically controlled, which gives the associated supramolecular material unique properties. For instance, formation and properties of these materials can be controlled over space and time by the kinetics of the coupled reaction network, they are autonomously self-healing and they are highly adaptive to small changes in their environment. By means of an example of a biological dissipative self-assembled material, the unique concepts at the basis of these supramolecular materials will be discussed. We then review recent efforts towards man-made dissipative assembly of structures and how their unique material properties have been characterized. In order to help further the field, we close with loosely defined design rules that are at the basis of the discussed examples.},

These supramolecular gels are often metastable materials, which implies that their properties are, at least partially, kinetically controlled. Here we show how the mechanical properties and structure of these materials can be controlled directly by catalytic action. We show how in situ catalysis of the formation of gelator molecules can be used to accelerate the formation of supramolecular hydrogels, which drastically enhances their resulting mechanical properties. Using acid or nucleophilic aniline catalysis, it is possible to make supramolecular hydrogels with tunable gel-strength in a matter of minutes, under ambient conditions, starting from simple soluble building blocks. By changing the rate of formation of the gelator molecules using a catalyst, the overall rate of gelation and the resulting gel morphology are affected, which provides access to metastable gel states with improved mechanical strength and appearance despite an identical gelator composition.},

This form of nonequilibrium self-organization allows the creation of structures that are inaccessible in equilibrium self-assembly. However, design strategies for dissipative self-assembly are limited by a lack of fundamental understanding of the process. This work proposes a novel route for dissipative self-assembly via the oscillation of interparticle potentials. It is demonstrated that in the limit of fast potential oscillations the structure of the system is exactly described by an effective potential that is the time average of the oscillatory potential. This effective potential depends on the shape of the oscillations and can lead to effective interactions that are physically inaccessible in equilibrium. As a proof of concept, Brownian dynamics simulations were performed on a binary mixture of particles coated by weak acids and weak bases under externally controlled oscillations of pH. Dissipative steady-state structures were formed when the period of the pH oscillations was smaller than the diffusional timescale of the particles, whereas disordered oscillating structures were observed for longer oscillation periods. Some of the dissipative structures (dimers, fibers, and honeycombs) cannot be obtained in equilibrium (fixed pH) simulations for the same system of particles. The transition from dissipative self-assembled structures for fast oscillations to disordered oscillating structures for slow oscillations is characterized by a maximum in the energy dissipated per oscillation cycle. The generality of the concept is demonstrated in a second system with oscillating particle sizes.},

How such an unstable state could have selected from an abiotic pool of molecules remains a mystery. Here we show that liquid phase-separation offers a mechanism for the selection of dissipative products from a library of reacting molecules. We bring a set of primitive carboxylic acids out-of-equilibrium by addition of high-energy condensing agents. The resulting anhydrides are transiently present before deactivation via hydrolysis. We find the anhydrides that phase-separate into droplets to protect themselves from hydrolysis and to be more persistent than non-assembling ones. Thus, after several starvation-refueling cycles, the library self-selects the phase-separating anhydrides. We observe that the self-selection mechanism is more effective when the library is brought out-of-equilibrium by periodic addition of batches as opposed to feeding it continuously. Our results suggest that phase-separation offers a selection mechanism for energy dissipating assemblies.},

The polar supramolecular material exhibits spontaneous second-harmonic generation from infrared to green photons and has an adhesive tape--like character with nonadhesive-hydrophobic and hydrophilic-sticky opposite surfaces. The films also have reasonable shear strength and adhere tenaciously to glass surfaces on one side only. The regular and finite size of the supramolecular units is believed to be mediated by repulsive forces among some of the segments in the triblock molecules. A large diversity of multifunctional materials could be formed from regular supramolecular units weighing hundreds of kilodaltons.}

However, despite increasing use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to directly image nanomorphology, it remains challenging to quantify the information embedded in TEM data sets, and to use nanomorphology to link synthesis and processing conditions to properties. We develop an automated, descriptor-free analysis workflow for TEM data that utilizes convolutional neural networks and unsupervised learning to quantify and classify nanomorphology, and thereby reveal synthesis--nanomorphology relationships in three different systems. While TEM records nanomorphology readily in two-dimensional (2D) images or three-dimensional (3D) tomograms, we advance the analysis of these images by identifying and applying a universal shape fingerprint function to characterize nanomorphology. After dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis, this function then serves as the input for morphology grouping through unsupervised learning. We demonstrate the wide applicability of our workflow to both 2D and 3D TEM data sets, and to both inorganic and organic nanomaterials, including tetrahedral gold nanoparticles mixed with irregularly shaped impurities, hybrid polymer-patched gold nanoprisms, and polyamide membranes with irregular and heterogeneous 3D crumple structures. In each of these systems, unsupervised nanomorphology grouping identifies both the diversity and the similarity of the nanomaterial across different synthesis conditions, revealing how synthetic parameters guide nanomorphology development. Our work opens possibilities for enhancing synthesis of nanomaterials through artificial intelligence and for understanding and controlling complex nanomorphology, both for 2D systems and in the far less explored case of 3D structures, such as those with embedded voids or hidden interfaces.},

Specifically, we first discuss standard real-space two-dimensional imaging and analytical techniques which are offered conveniently by microscopes without special holders or advanced beam technology. The discussion is then extended to recent advancements, including visualizing three-dimensional morphology of soft nanomaterials using electron tomography and its variations, identifying local structure and strain by electron diffraction, and recording motions and transformation by in situ EM. On these advancements, we cover state-of-the-art technologies designed for overcoming the technical barriers for EM to characterize soft materials as well as representative application examples.

With our perspectives of future opportunities offered at the end, we expect this review to inspire and stimulate more efforts in developing and utilizing EM-based characterization methods for soft nanomaterials at the atomic to nanometer length scales in academic research and industrial applications.}

  abstract = {The incorporation of molecular switches in organic structures is of great interest in the chemical design of stimuli-responsive materials that mimic the complex functions of living systems. Merocyanine dyes that convert to spiropyran moieties upon exposure to visible light have been extensively studied as they can be incorporated in hydrated covalent networks that will expel water when this conversion occurs and induce a volumetric shrinkage. We report here on a sulfonate-based water-soluble photoswitch that, in contrast to the well-known systems, triggers a volumetric expansion in hydrogels upon exposure to photons. Contraction is in turn observed under dark conditions in a highly reversible manner. The novel behavior of the photoswitch incorporated in the covalent network was predicted by coarse-grained simulations of the system's chemical structure. Using pH control and polymeric structures that differ in lower critical solution temperature, we were able to develop hydrogels with highly tunable volumetric expansion. The novel molecular function of the systems developed here led to materials with the negative phototaxis observed in plants and could expand the potential use of hydrogels as sensors, soft robots, and actuators.}

These competing interactions can be selectively switched on and off, with the order of doing so determining the position of the final product in the energy landscape. Within the same energy landscape, the peptide-amphiphile system forms a thermodynamically favoured product characterized by long bundled fibres that promote biological cell adhesion and survival, and a metastable product characterized by short monodisperse fibres that interfere with adhesion and can lead to cell death. Our findings suggest that, in supramolecular systems, functions and energy landscapes are linked, superseding the more traditional connection between molecular design and function.},

In living systems the integration of supramolecular structures and covalent polymers contributes to the responsive behaviour of membranes, muscles and tendons, among others. Here we describe hybrid light-responsive soft materials composed of peptide amphiphile supramolecular polymers chemically bonded to spiropyran-based networks that expel water in response to visible light. The supramolecular polymers form a reversibly deformable and water-draining skeleton that mechanically reinforces the hybrid and can also be aligned by printing methods. The noncovalent skeleton embedded in the network thus enables faster bending and flattening actuation of objects, as well as longer steps during the light-driven crawling motion of macroscopic films. Our work suggests that hybrid bonding polymers, which integrate supramolecular assemblies and covalent networks, offer strategies for the bottom-up design of soft matter that mimics living organisms.},

The models have been developed at many different levels of theory, going all the way from simple analytical models of packing effects to atomistic descriptions using molecular dynamics methods. In between these limits are mean-field and coarse-grained models, including models for DNA, peptides, and lipids that can be used to describe the assembly of hybrid (amphiphilic) materials. Several recent applications to specific systems are discussed, including the description of peptide amphiphile assembly to make cylindrical micelles, the assembly and melting of DNA hairpins, the use of DNA tethers to assemble nanoparticles into aggregates and crystalline structures, and the use of coarse-grained lipid models to make lamellar and high-curvature phases. These examples demonstrate the difficulties associated with brute force atomistic methods, and they also show the opportunities (but uncertainties and ambiguities) associated with simpler models such as coarse-grained models. The examples also demonstrate the usefulness of successful modeling methods in the design of new materials, including an understanding of the relationship between structure and function.},

Several approaches have been considered for stationary dynamics, some of which are based on a variational characterization of the entropy production rate. However, the issue of obtaining it in the case of non-stationary dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here, we solve this open problem by demonstrating that the variational approaches can be generalized to give the exact value of the entropy production rate even for non-stationary dynamics. On the basis of this result, we develop an efficient algorithm that estimates the entropy production rate continuously in time by using machine learning techniques and validate our numerical estimates using analytically tractable Langevin models in experimentally relevant parameter regimes. Our method only requires time-series data for the system of interest without any prior knowledge of the system's parameters.},

We begin with the simple example of a diffusive particle whose position is reset randomly in time with a constant rate r, which corresponds to Poissonian resetting, to some fixed point (e.g. its initial position). This simple system already exhibits the main features of interest induced by resetting: (i) the system reaches a nontrivial nonequilibrium stationary state (ii) the mean time for the particle to reach a target is finite and has a minimum, optimal, value as a function of the resetting rate r. We then generalise to an arbitrary stochastic process (e.g. L{\'e}vy flights or fractional Brownian motion) and non-Poissonian resetting (e.g. power-law waiting time distribution for intervals between resetting events). We go on to discuss multiparticle systems as well as extended systems, such as fluctuating interfaces, under resetting. We also consider resetting with memory which implies resetting the process to some randomly selected previous time. Finally we give an overview of recent developments and applications in the field.},

Here, we examine their roles in dynamics; specifically, in the degree of deterministic chaos using the Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy rate and the spectra of Lyapunov exponents. With computer simulations of three-dimensional Lennard-Jones and Weeks-Chandler-Andersen fluids, we find repulsive forces dictate these dynamical properties, with attractive forces reducing the KS entropy at a given thermodynamic state. Regardless of interparticle forces, the maximal Lyapunov exponent is intensive for systems ranging from 200 to 2000 particles. Our finite-size scaling analysis also shows that the KS entropy is both extensive (a linear function of system-size) and additive. Both temperature and density control the ``dynamical chemical potential,'' the rate of linear growth of the KS entropy with system size. At fixed system-size, both the KS entropy and the largest exponent exhibit a maximum as a function of density. We attribute the maxima to the competition between two effects: as particles are forced to be in closer proximity, there is an enhancement from the sharp curvature of the repulsive potential and a suppression from the diminishing free volume and particle mobility. The extensivity and additivity of the KS entropy and the intensivity of the largest Lyapunov exponent, however, hold over a range of temperatures and densities across the liquid and liquid-vapor coexistence regimes.},

  abstract = {The question of how reversible microscopic equations of motion can lead to irreversible macroscopic behaviour has been one of the central issues in statistical mechanics for more than a century. The basic issues were known to Gibbs. Boltzmann conducted a very public debate with Loschmidt and others without a satisfactory resolution. In recent decades there has been no real change in the situation. In 1993 we discovered a relation, subsequently known as the Fluctuation Theorem (FT), which gives an analytical expression for the probability of observing Second Law violating dynamical fluctuations in thermostatted dissipative non-equilibrium systems. The relation was derived heuristically and applied to the special case of dissipative non-equilibrium systems subject to constant energy 'thermostatting'. These restrictions meant that the full importance of the Theorem was not immediately apparent. Within a few years, derivations of the Theorem were improved but it has only been in the last few of years that the generality of the Theorem has been appreciated. We now know that the Second Law of Thermodynamics can be derived assuming ergodicity at equilibrium, and causality. We take the assumption of causality to be axiomatic. It is causality which ultimately is responsible for breaking time reversal symmetry and which leads to the possibility of irreversible macroscopic behaviour. The Fluctuation Theorem does much more than merely prove that in large systems observed for long periods of time, the Second Law is overwhelmingly likely to be valid. The Fluctuation Theorem quantifies the probability of observing Second Law violations in small systems observed for a short time. Unlike the Boltzmann equation, the FT is completely consistent with Loschmidt's observation that for time reversible dynamics, every dynamical phase space trajectory and its conjugate time reversed 'anti-trajectory', are both solutions of the underlying equations of motion. Indeed the standard proofs of the FT explicitly consider conjugate pairs of phase space trajectories. Quantitative predictions made by the Fluctuation Theorem regarding the probability of Second Law violations have been confirmed experimentally, both using molecular dynamics computer simulation and very recently in laboratory experiments.},

  abstract = {Recently, geometrical aspects of quantum information have attracted considerable attention due to their applicability in promising new quantum technologies. In particular, the quantum Fisher information has gained prominence for its utility within the field of quantum sensing through the Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound. Closely related concepts, such as quantum variance and co-variance, fidelity susceptibility, entanglement entropy and Berry curvature have also been extensively studied. While classical information geometry has been developed as a sub-field of mathematical statistics since the late 1950s, it has had a more limited impact within the field of condensed matter physics. Despite this, the generalization of information geometry to incorporate quantum mechanics provides a natural framework for understanding all the above concepts in a unified manner. Starting from an introduction to classical information geometry and Shannon information, we discuss the difficulties in generalizing the classical results to the quantum case and present a pedagogical guide to quantum information geometry. Rather than a thorough review of the by now extensive literature, the intention is to emphasize the unifying framework relating the different concepts and to discuss their applicability to quantum sensing, as well as to the detection of quantum criticality via fidelity susceptibility, and to the understanding of topological properties of ground state manifolds. General relations between the quantum Fisher information and response functions are derived, and scaling relations are discussed, along with bounds relevant to quantum enhanced metrology. Several examples are given for simple one and two qubit systems.},

By allowing only fast-moving molecules to pass from left to right, and slowmoving molecules right to left, the demon induces heating in the right compartment and cooling in the left. Such shifts from equilibrium violate the second law of thermodynamics. A team from the School of Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh --- a cab ride from Maxwell's birthplace --- has now developed a molecular 'machine' that mimics the battle of Maxwell's demon against equilibrium. The new demon is a specially designed rotaxane --- a molecular ring threaded onto a central axle with binding sites where the ring can attach. Previous rotaxane machines were activated by disturbing the ring binding pattern; the ring shuttled between binding sites and moved the system back towards equilibrium. In the new rotaxane, information about ring location is used to move the system away from equilibrium. But the second law survives the assault, as it costs energy (provided as light) to gather and transfer molecular information.},

Given that it has been thoroughly analyzed, we analyze Szilard's remaining two demon models. We show that the second one, though a markedly different implementation employing a population of distinct molecular species and semipermeable membranes, is informationally and thermodynamically equivalent to an ideal gas of the single-molecule engines. One concludes that (i) it reduces to a chaotic dynamical system-called the Szilard Map, a composite of three piecewise linear maps and associated thermodynamic transformations that implement measurement, control, and erasure; (ii) its transitory functioning as an engine that converts disorganized heat energy to work is governed by the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate; (iii) the demon's minimum necessary "intelligence" for optimal functioning is given by the engine's statistical complexity; and (iv) its functioning saturates thermodynamic bounds and so it is a minimal, optimal implementation. We show that Szilard's third construction is rather different and addresses the fundamental issue raised by the first two: the link between entropy production and the measurement task required to implement either of his engines. The analysis gives insight into designing and implementing novel nanoscale information engines by investigating the relationships between the demon's memory, the nature of the "working fluid," and the thermodynamic costs of erasure and measurement.},

Stochastic thermodynamics formalizes what the demon has taught us informally---namely, that information is a resource that can enhance the ability of a system to do work, and erasure of each bit of information in the demon's memory increases entropy by kB ln 2 (with kB being Boltzmann's constant), assuring the sanctity of the second law. Without Maxwell's demon, it is questionable whether stochastic thermodynamics and a host of interesting nonmacroscopic experimental results would exist today.},

  abstract = {The relation between entropy and information dates back to the classical Maxwell demon paradox1, a thought experiment proposed in 1867 by James Clerk Maxwell to violate the second law of thermodynamics. A variant of the classical Maxwell demon is the Szilard engine, proposed by Leo Szilard in 19291. In it, at a given time, the demon observes the compartment occupied by a single molecule in a vessel and extracts work by operating a pulley device. Here, we introduce the continuous Maxwell demon, a device capable of extracting arbitrarily large amounts of work per cycle by repeated measurements of the state of a system, and experimentally test it in single DNA hairpin pulling experiments. In the continuous Maxwell demon, the demon monitors the state of the DNA hairpin (folded or unfolded) by observing it at equally spaced time intervals, but it extracts work only when the molecule changes state. We demonstrate that the average maximum work per cycle that can be extracted by the continuous Maxwell demon is limited by the information content of the stored sequences, in agreement with the second law. Work extraction efficiency is found to be maximal in the large information-content limit where work extraction is fuelled by rare events.},

In our experiment, atoms are confined to a far-detuned dipole trap consisting of a single focused Gaussian beam, which is divided near the focus by the barrier. The one-way barrier consists of two focused laser beams oriented almost normal to the dipole-trap axis. The first beam is tuned to present either a potential well or barrier, depending on the state of the incident atoms.

The background of this topic is the recently-developed nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and quantum (and classical) information theory. These theories are closely related to the modern technologies to manipulate and observe small systems; for example, macromolecules and colloidal particles in the classical regime, and quantum-optical systems and quantum dots in the quantum regime.First, we review a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics to the situations in which small thermodynamic systems are subject to quantum feedback control. The generalized second law is expressed in terms of an inequality that includes the term of information obtained by the measurement, as well as the thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy. This inequality leads to the fundamental upper bound of the work that can be extracted by a ``Maxwell's demon'', which can be regarded as a feedback controller with a memory that stores measurement outcomes.Second, we review generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics to the measurement and information erasure processes of the memory of the demon that is a quantum system. The generalized second laws consist of inequalities that identify the lower bounds of the energy costs that are needed for the measurement and the information erasure. The inequality for the erasure leads to the celebrated Landauer's principle for a special case. Moreover, these inequalities enable us to reconcile Maxwell's demon with the second law of thermodynamics.In these inequalities, thermodynamic quantities and information contents are treated on an equal footing. In fact, the inequalities are model-independent, so that they can be applied to a broad class of information processing. Therefore, these inequalities can be called the second law of ``information thermodynamics''.},

  abstract = {We introduce a family of Maxwellian Demons for which correlations among information bearing degrees of freedom can be calculated exactly and in compact analytical form. This allows one to precisely determine Demon functional thermodynamic operating regimes, when previous methods either misclassify or simply fail due to approximations they invoke. This reveals that these Demons are more functional than previous candidates. They too behave either as engines, lifting a mass against gravity by extracting energy from a single heat reservoir, or as Landauer erasers, consuming external work to remove information from a sequence of binary symbols by decreasing their individual uncertainty. Going beyond these, our Demon exhibits a new functionality that erases bits not by simply decreasing individual-symbol uncertainty, but by increasing inter-bit correlations (that is, by adding temporal order) while increasing single-symbol uncertainty. In all cases, but especially in the new erasure regime, exactly accounting for informational correlations leads to tight bounds on Demon performance, expressed as a refined Second Law of thermodynamics that relies on the Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy for dynamical processes and not on changes purely in system configurational entropy, as previously employed. We rigorously derive the refined Second Law under minimal assumptions and so it applies quite broadly---for Demons with and without memory and input sequences that are correlated or not. We note that general Maxwellian Demons readily violate previously proposed, alternative such bounds, while the current bound still holds. As such, it broadly describes the minimal energetic cost of any computation by a thermodynamic system.},

  abstract = {Information processing typically occurs via the composition of modular units, such as the universal logic gates found in discrete computation circuits. The benefit of modular information processing, in contrast to globally integrated information processing, is that complex computations are more easily and flexibly implemented via a series of simpler, localized information processing operations that only control and change local degrees of freedom. We show that, despite these benefits, there are unavoidable thermodynamic costs to modularity---costs that arise directly from the operation of localized processing and that go beyond Landauer's bound on the work required to erase information. Localized operations are unable to leverage global correlations, which are a thermodynamic fuel. We quantify the minimum irretrievable dissipation of modular computations in terms of the difference between the change in global nonequilibrium free energy, which captures these global correlations, and the local (marginal) change in nonequilibrium free energy, which bounds modular work production. This modularity dissipation is proportional to the amount of additional work required to perform a computational task modularly, measuring a structural energy cost. It determines the thermodynamic efficiency of different modular implementations of the same computation, and so it has immediate consequences for the architecture of physically embedded transducers, known as information ratchets. Constructively, we show how to circumvent modularity dissipation by designing internal ratchet states that capture the information reservoir's global correlations and patterns. Thus, there are routes to thermodynamic efficiency that circumvent globally integrated protocols and instead reduce modularity dissipation to optimize the architecture of computations composed of a series of localized operations.},

Forward (unfolding) and reverse (refolding) work distribution are numerically calculated for various duration times of the non equilibrium experiments. Crooks theorem is accurately verified for all non equilibrium regimes and the time asymmetry of the process is measured using the recently proposed Jensen--Shannon divergence [E.H. Feng, G. Crooks, Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 090602 (2008)]. Results on the alanine decapeptide are found similar to recent experimental data on m-RNA molecule in solution, thus evidencing the universal character of the Jensen--Shannon divergence. The patent non Markovianity of the process is rationalized by assuming that the observed forward and reverse distributions can be each described by a combination of two normal distributions satisfying the Crooks theorem, representative of two mutually exclusive linear events. Such bimodal approach reproduces with surprising accuracy the observed non Markovian work distributions.},

  abstract = {The determination of the folding dynamics of polypeptides and proteins is critical in characterizing their functions in biological systems. Numerous computational models and methods have been developed for studying structure formation at the atomic level. Due to its small size and simple structure, deca-alanine is used as a model system in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The free energy of unfolding in vacuum has been studied extensively using the end-to-end distance of the peptide as the reaction coordinate. However, few studies have been conducted in the presence of explicit solvent. Previous results show a significant decrease in the free energy of extended conformations in water, but the {$\alpha$}-helical state is still notably favored over the extended state. Although sufficient in vacuum, we show that end-to-end distance is incapable of capturing the full complexity of deca-alanine folding in water. Using {$\alpha$}-helical content as a second reaction coordinate, we deduce a more descriptive free-energy landscape, one which reveals a second energy minimum in the extended conformations that is of comparable free energy to the {$\alpha$}-helical state. Equilibrium simulations demonstrate the relative stability of the extended and {$\alpha$}-helical states in water as well as the transition between the two states. This work reveals both the necessity and challenge of determining a proper reaction coordinate to fully characterize a given process.},

To date, the studies on Brownian information engines consider the system in a thermal bath; however, many processes in nature occur in a nonequilibrium setting, such as the suspensions of self-propelled microorganisms or cellular environments called an active bath. Here, we introduce an archetypal model for a Maxwell-demon type cyclic Brownian information engine operating in a Gaussian correlated active bath capable of extracting more work than its thermal counterpart. We obtain a general integral fluctuation theorem for the active engine that includes additional mutual information gained from the active bath with a unique effective temperature. This effective description modifies the generalized second law and provides a new upper bound for the extracted work. Unlike the passive information engine operating in a thermal bath, the active information engine extracts colossal power that peaks at the finite cycle period. Our study provides fundamental insights into the design and functioning of synthetic and biological submicrometer motors in active baths under measurement and feedback control.},

Adaptive steered molecular dynamics (ASMD) has been seen to provide a significant computational advantage by limiting the spread of the trajectories in a staged approach. The contraction of the trajectories at the end of each stage can be performed by taking a structure whose nonequilibrium work is closest to the Jarzynski average (in naive ASMD) or by relaxing the trajectories under a no-work condition (in full-relaxation ASMD---namely, FR-ASMD). Both approaches have been used to determine the energetics and hydrogen-bonding structure along the pathway for unfolding of a benchmark peptide initially constrained as an {$\alpha$}-helix in a water environment. The energetics are quite different to those in vacuum, but are found to be similar between implicit and explicit solvents. Surprisingly, the hydrogen-bonding pathways are also similar in the implicit and explicit solvents despite the fact that the solvent contact plays an important role in opening the helix.},

We outline the theory that serves this purpose and connects nonequilibrium processes (such as SMD simulations) with equilibrium properties (such as the PMF). We review the derivation of Jarzynski's equality, generalize it to isobaric--isothermal processes, and discuss its implications in relation to the second law of thermodynamics and computer simulations. In the relevant regime of steering by means of stiff springs, we demonstrate that the work on the system is Gaussian-distributed regardless of the speed of the process simulated. In this case, the cumulant expansion of Jarzynski's equality can be safely terminated at second order. We illustrate the PMF calculation method for an exemplary simulation and demonstrate the Gaussian nature of the resulting work distribution.},

By allowing only fast-moving molecules to pass from left to right, and slowmoving molecules right to left, the demon induces heating in the right compartment and cooling in the left. Such shifts from equilibrium violate the second law of thermodynamics. A team from the School of Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh --- a cab ride from Maxwell's birthplace --- has now developed a molecular 'machine' that mimics the battle of Maxwell's demon against equilibrium. The new demon is a specially designed rotaxane --- a molecular ring threaded onto a central axle with binding sites where the ring can attach. Previous rotaxane machines were activated by disturbing the ring binding pattern; the ring shuttled between binding sites and moved the system back towards equilibrium. In the new rotaxane, information about ring location is used to move the system away from equilibrium. But the second law survives the assault, as it costs energy (provided as light) to gather and transfer molecular information.},

These biomolecular motors have evolved to be well-suited to the tasks they perform. Synthetic systems that function through similar mechanisms have recently been developed, and their minimalist structures enable the influence of structural changes on machine performance to be assessed. Here, we probe the effect of changes in the fuel and barrier-forming species on the nonequilibrium operation of a carbodiimide-fueled rotaxane-based information ratchet. We examine the machine's ability to catalyze the fuel-to-waste reaction and harness energy from it to drive directional displacement of the macrocycle. These characteristics are intrinsically linked to the speed, force, power, and efficiency of the ratchet output. We find that, just as for biomolecular motors and macroscopic machinery, optimization of one feature (such as speed) can compromise other features (such as the force that can be generated by the ratchet). Balancing speed, power, efficiency, and directionality will likely prove important when developing artificial molecular motors for particular applications.},

We also bound the speed of quantum and classical synchronization in coupled damped oscillators with non-Hermitian anti-PT-symmetric interactions, and show that the speed of synchronization is limited by the interaction strength relative to the damping. Compared to the classical limit, we find that quantum synchronization is slowed by the non-commutativity of the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian terms. Our general results could be tested experimentally and we suggest an implementation in photonic systems.},

This behavior indicates an increase in the degree of nearly quasiperiodic motion near the Ar3 saddle due to the partial decoupling of the cluster's vibrational modes there. Lennard-Jones Ar5 clusters do not exhibit similar behavior, but Ar5 clusters bound with a short-range Morse potential do. This suggests that the ``regularizing'' effect of saddle regions is strongly dependent on the shape of the energy surface near the saddle.

To determine the degree of regularity of the dynamics, the fractal dimension of probability fluxes is calculated on the basis of simulated folding trajectories. It has been found that the phases of regular and irregular dynamics alternate as follows. In the initial (collapse) phase of folding, the dynamics are essentially regular. Then, as the protein comes to the basin of semicompact states that precedes the transition state, the dynamics become irregular. At the transition state, the dynamics are regularized again but become less regular when the nativelike states are explored. Depending on the specific conditions at which the protein folding was considered, some phases of the dynamics could not be well resolved, but no significant deviation from this general picture has been observed. The regularization of the dynamics at the transition state is discussed in relation to the recent studies of the Hamiltonian dynamics of small clusters, where both regular and chaotic dynamics were observed depending on the flatness of the energy surface at the transition state.},

We extend our previous work, which relied either on a harmonic approximation or on periodic force driving. We demonstrate that the reaction rate, expressed as the long-time flux of reactive trajectories, can be extracted directly from the stability exponents, namely, Lyapunov exponents, of the moving dividing surface. Comparison to numerical results demonstrates the accuracy and robustness of this approach for the computation of optimal (recrossing-free) dividing surfaces and reaction rates in systems with Markovian solvation forces. The resulting reaction rates are in strong agreement with those determined from the long-time flux of reactive trajectories.},

Here, we explore these effects using constant energy molecular dynamics simulations and independent criteria associated with locally chaotic behavior -- namely, the constancy of the local mode action and the magnitude of finite-time Lyapunov exponents. These criteria reconcile the chaotic basins and relatively ordered saddles of the Lennard-Jones trimer, with the chaotic saddles and ordered basins for reactive, all-atom H2O described by the Garofalini H2O potential. By modifying the Garofalini and Lennard-Jones models we separate the compounding effects of nonlinear three-body interactions and steep reaction path curvature on the local degree of chaos near saddles and minima.},

  abstract = {Bulk properties of equilibrium liquids are a manifestation of intermolecular forces. Here, we show how these forces imprint on dynamical fluctuations in the Lyapunov exponents for simple fluids with and without attractive forces. While the bulk of the spectrum is strongly self-averaging, the first Lyapunov exponent self-averages only weakly and at a rate that depends on the length scale of the intermolecular forces; short-range repulsive forces quantitatively dominate longer-range attractive forces, which act as a weak perturbation that slows the convergence to the thermodynamic limit. Regardless of intermolecular forces, the fluctuations in the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate diverge, as one expects for an extensive quantity, and the spontaneous fluctuations of these dynamical observables obey fluctuation-dissipation-like relationships. Together, these results are a representation of the van der Waals picture of fluids and another lens through which we can view the liquid state.},

Despite a rich phenomenology, however, there is not currently an explanation of the mechanical instability in the molecular motion at this critical point. Here, we couple techniques from nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics to analyze the emergence of this singular state. Numerical simulations and analytical models show how the ordering mechanisms of critical dynamics are measurable through the hierarchy of spatiotemporal Lyapunov vectors. A subset of unstable vectors soften near the critical point, with a marked suppression in their characteristic exponents that reflects a weakened sensitivity to initial conditions. Finite-time fluctuations in these exponents exhibit sharply peaked dynamical timescales and power law signatures of the critical dynamics. Collectively, these results are symptomatic of a critical slowing down of chaos that sits at the root of our statistical understanding of the liquid--vapor critical point.},

Unfortunately, the successes of equilibrium statistical mechanics are hardto replicate out of equilibrium, where the a priori probabilities of observing states are, in general, not known, precluding the na{\"{\i}}ve application of common tools. In the last decade, exciting developments have occurred that enable direct numerical estimation of the entropy and density of states of athermal and non-equilibrium systems, thanks to significant methodological advances in the computation of the volume of high-dimensional basins of attraction.

In the global setting, we use diffusion maps to identify metastable sets and to approximate the corresponding committor functions of transitions between them. We also discuss the use of diffusion maps within the metastable sets, formalizing the locality via the concept of the quasi-stationary distribution and justifying the convergence of diffusion maps within a local equilibrium. This perspective allows us to propose an enhanced sampling algorithm. We demonstrate the practical relevance of these approaches both for simple models and for molecular dynamics problems (alanine dipeptide and deca-alanine).},

This approach relies on the continuous estimation of a biasing force that yields a Hamiltonian in which no average force is exerted along the ordering parameter {$\xi$}. Optimizing the parameters that control how the ABF is applied, the method is shown to be extremely effective when a nonequivocal ordering parameter can be defined to explore the folding pathway of the peptide. Starting from a {$\beta$}-turn motif and restraining {$\xi$} to a region of the conformational space that extends from the {$\alpha$}-helical state to an ensemble of extended structures, the ABF scheme is successful in folding the peptide chain into a compact {$\alpha$} helix. Sampling of this conformation is, however, marginal when the range of {$\xi$} values embraces arrangements of greater compactness, hence demonstrating the inherent limitations of free-energy methods when ambiguous ordering parameters are utilized.},

A crucial driver of these dynamics is the cellular cytoskeleton, a defining example of an active material where the energy injected by molecular motors cascades across length scales, allowing the material to break the constraints of thermodynamic equilibrium and display emergent nonequilibrium dynamics only possible due to the constant influx of energy. Notwithstanding recent experimental advances in the use of local probes to quantify entropy production and the breaking of detailed balance, little is known about the energetics of active materials or how energy propagates from the molecular to emergent length scales. Here, we use a recently developed picowatt calorimeter to experimentally measure the energetics of an active microtubule gel that displays emergent large-scale flows. We find that only approximately one-billionth of the system's total energy consumption contributes to these emergent flows. We develop a chemical kinetics model that quantitatively captures how the system's total thermal dissipation varies with ATP and microtubule concentrations but that breaks down at high motor concentration, signaling an interference between motors. Finally, we estimate how energy losses accumulate across scales. Taken together, these results highlight energetic efficiency as a key consideration for the engineering of active materials and are a powerful step toward developing a nonequilibrium thermodynamics of living systems.},

The periodic beating of an isolated flagellum from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibits probability flux in the phase space of shapes.

In many cases they require minimal coding, just a mathematical description of the desired function. They also require no modification to OpenMM itself and can be distributed independently of OpenMM.

  abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) and other related kinetic network models are frequently used to study the long-timescale dynamical behavior of biomolecular and materials systems. MSMs are often constructed bottom-up using brute-force molecular dynamics (MD) simulations when the model contains a large number of states and kinetic pathways that are not known a priori. However, the resulting network generally encompasses only parts of the configurational space, and regardless of any additional MD performed, several states and pathways will still remain missing. This implies that the duration for which the MSM can faithfully capture the true dynamics, which we term as the validity time for the MSM, is always finite and unfortunately much shorter than the MD time invested to construct the model. A general framework that relates the kinetic uncertainty in the model to the validity time, missing states and pathways, network topology, and statistical sampling is presented. Performing additional calculations for frequently-sampled states/pathways may not alter the MSM validity time. A new class of enhanced kinetic sampling techniques is introduced that aims at targeting rare states/pathways that contribute most to the uncertainty so that the validity time is boosted in an effective manner. Examples including straightforward 1D energy landscapes, lattice models, and biomolecular systems are provided to illustrate the application of the method. Developments presented here will be of interest to the kinetic Monte Carlo community as well.},

Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications.

And, there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from peptide fragments, local structures first.},

The correlation coefficient is 0.74 or higher, and indicates that it is possible to predict the folding time of a protein with a precision of {$\sim$}1.1 times decades from just its size. A simple thermodynamic analysis of this correlation suggests that the smallest proteins are expected to have very marginal free energy barriers to folding.}

Like traditional rate processes, fast folding proteins have activation barriers at low temperatures, but unlike traditional processes, they have negative activation energies at high temperatures. We develop a model of ultrafast folders that joins a macroscopic mass-action model with a microscopic energy landscape description; we call it the Thruway Search Model. We find good agreement with experimental rates and equilibria on 13 ultrafast folders. The observed folding rates are found to be proportional to the number of microscopic folding routes:\, fast-folding proteins have more parallel microscopic routes on energy landscapes. At high temperatures, where traditional barriers are small, the remaining bottleneck is a search through denatured conformations to find thruway routes to the native state. Negative activation arises because increasing temperature expands the denatured ensemble, broadening the search, slowing the folding to the native state. We find that the upper estimate of the free energy barriers are positive but small, as little as 0.5 kT.},

The simulations included 150, 212, and 48 folding events at room temperature for TZ1, TZ2, and TZ3, respectively. The all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLSaa) potential set predicted TZ1 and TZ2 properties well; the estimated folding rates agreed with the experimentally determined folding rates and native conformations were the global potential-energy minimum. The simulations also predicted reasonable unfolding activation enthalpies. This work, directly comparing large simulated folding ensembles with multiple spectroscopic probes, revealed both the surprising predictive ability of current models as well as their shortcomings. Specifically, for TZ1--TZ3, OPLS for united atom models had a nonnative free-energy minimum, and the folding rate for OPLSaa TZ3 was sensitive to the initial conformation. Finally, we characterized the transition state; all TZs fold by means of similar, native-like transition-state conformations.},

The systems can attain a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) under chemiostatic condition, which becomes the state of true thermodynamic equilibrium when detailed balance holds. We show that there exists a universal functional relationship of the EPR with reaction rate close to steady states for all the networks considered. Near a NESS, the former varies linearly with the reaction rate. On the other hand, around a true equilibrium, it varies quadratically with the latter. Numerical experiments justify our analytical findings quite transparently.},

The introduction of the laser temperature-jump (T-jump) to biophysics more than a decade ago opened these previously inaccessible time regimes up to direct experimental observation. Since then, laser T-jump methodology has evolved into one of the most versatile and generally applicable methods for studying fast biomolecular kinetics. This perspective is a review of the principles and applications of the laser T-jump technique in biophysics. A brief overview of the T-jump relaxation kinetics and the historical development of laser T-jump methodology is presented. The physical principles and practical experimental considerations that are important for the design of the laser T-jump experiments are summarized. These include the Raman conversion for generating heating pulses, considerations of size, duration and uniformity of the temperature jump, as well as potential adverse effects due to photo-acoustic waves, cavitation and thermal lensing, and their elimination. The laser T-jump apparatus developed at the NIH Laboratory of Chemical Physics is described in detail along with a brief survey of other laser T-jump designs in use today. Finally, applications of the laser T-jump in biophysics are reviewed, with an emphasis on the broad range of problems where the laser T-jump methodology has provided important new results and insights into the dynamics of the biomolecular processes.},

Exact time-dependent solutions of the CME -- which typically consists of infinitely many coupled differential equations -- are rare, and are valuable for numerical benchmarking and getting intuition for the behavior of more complicated systems. Jahnke and Huisinga's landmark calculation of the exact time-dependent solution of the CME for monomolecular reaction systems is one of the most general analytic results known; however, it is hard to generalize, because it relies crucially on properties of monomolecular reactions. In this paper, we rederive Jahnke and Huisinga's result on the time-dependent probability distribution and moments of monomolecular reaction systems using the Doi-Peliti path integral approach, which reduces solving the CME to evaluating many integrals. While the Doi-Peliti approach is less intuitive, it is also more mechanical, and hence easier to generalize. To illustrate how the Doi-Peliti approach can go beyond the method of Jahnke and Huisinga, we also find an explicit and exact time-dependent solution to a problem involving an autocatalytic reaction that Jahnke and Huisinga identified as not solvable using their method. We also find a formal exact time-dependent solution for any CME whose list of reactions involves only zero and first order reactions, which may be the most general result currently known.},

The bounds involve only the initial data, the energy uncertainty in the initial state, and the energy uncertainty in the reference subspace. They describe how fast the state enters or leaves the reference subspace. They are exact if, but not only if, the initial state or the projection onto the reference subspace commutes with the Hamiltonian. The basic tool used in the proof is a simple inequality for expectation values of commutators, which generalizes the usual uncertainty relation. By introducing suitable comparison dynamics (trial propagators), the bounds can be made arbitrarily tight. They represent a time-dependent variational principle, in terms of trial propagators, which provides explicit error estimates and reproduces the exact time evolution when one varies over all trial propagators. As illustrations, we derive accurate lower bounds on the escape time of a particle out of a potential well modeling a quantum dot, and the total time before which a He+ ion moving in a uniform magnetic field loses its electron.},

However, few studies have been conducted in the presence of explicit solvent. Previous results show a significant decrease in the free energy of extended conformations in water, but the {$\alpha$}-helical state is still notably favored over the extended state. Although sufficient in vacuum, we show that end-to-end distance is incapable of capturing the full complexity of deca-alanine folding in water. Using {$\alpha$}-helical content as a second reaction coordinate, we deduce a more descriptive free-energy landscape, one which reveals a second energy minimum in the extended conformations that is of comparable free energy to the {$\alpha$}-helical state. Equilibrium simulations demonstrate the relative stability of the extended and {$\alpha$}-helical states in water as well as the transition between the two states. This work reveals both the necessity and challenge of determining a proper reaction coordinate to fully characterize a given process.},

However, it is not known which resources fundamentally limit the precision of sensing, like weak links in a chain, and which can compensate each other, leading to trade-offs between them. We show by modeling that in equilibrium systems the precision is limited by the number of receptors; the downstream network can never increase precision. This limit arises from a trade-off between the removal of extrinsic noise in the receptor and intrinsic noise in the downstream network. Non-equilibrium systems can lift this trade-off by storing the receptor state over time in chemical modification states of downstream molecules. As we quantify for a push-pull network, this requires i) time and receptors; ii) downstream molecules; iii) energy (fuel turnover) to drive modification. These three resource classes cannot compensate each other, and it is the limiting class which sets the fundamental sensing limit. Within each class, trade-offs are possible. Energy allows a power-speed trade-off, while time can be traded against receptors.},

Here, we report a new approach to transient amide bond formation and use it to harness chemical energy and convert it to mechanical motion by integrating dissipative self-assembly and the Marangoni effect in a source-sink system. Droplets are formed through dissipative self-assembly following the reaction of octylamine with 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride. The resulting amides are hydrolytically labile making the droplets transient, which allows them to act as a source of octylamine. A sink for octylamine was created by placing a drop of oleic acid on the air-water interface. This source -- sink system sets up a gradient in surface tension, which gives rise to a macroscopic Marangoni flow that can transport the droplets in solution with tunable speed. Carbodiimides can fuel this motion by converting diacid waste back to anhydride. This study shows how fueling at the molecular level can, via assembly at the supramolecular level, lead to liquid flow at the macroscopic level.},

To this end, the processing of complex materials such as polymer melts and nanocomposites generally occurs under strong deformations and flows, conditions under which equilibrium thermodynamics does not apply. As a result, the ability to determine the nonequilibrium thermodynamic properties of polymeric materials from measurable quantities such as heat and work is a major challenge in the field. Here, we use work relations to show that nonequilibrium thermodynamic quantities such as free energy and entropy can be determined for dilute polymer solutions in flow. In this way, we determine the thermodynamic properties of DNA molecules in strong flows using a combination of simulations, kinetic theory, and single molecule experiments. We show that it is possible to calculate polymer relaxation timescales purely from polymer stretching dynamics in flow. We further observe a thermodynamic equivalence between nonequilibrium and equilibrium steady-states for polymeric systems. In this way, our results provide an improved understanding of the energetics of flowing polymer solutions.},

The bound leads to further insights beyond the previous bounds on concrete evolution modes of the quantum system, such as horizontal or parallel transition or horizontal joining of the two quantum states in Hilbert space. The bound is linked to the feasibility of the evolutions of the state vectors, and provides a tighter upper bound. In addition, the generalized Margolus-Levitin bound is discussed.},

  abstract = {The Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, known as the pioneering algorithm for solving linear equations in quantum computers, is expected to accelerate solving large-scale linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To efficiently combine classical and quantum computers for high-cost chemical problems, non-linear ODEs (e.g., chemical reactions) must be linearized to the highest possible accuracy. However, the linearization approach has not been fully established yet. In this study, Carleman linearization was examined to transform nonlinear first-order ODEs of chemical reactions into linear ODEs. Although this linearization theoretically requires the generation of an infinite matrix, the original nonlinear equations can be reconstructed. For the practical use, the linearized system should be truncated with finite size and the extent of the truncation determines analysis precision. Matrix should be sufficiently large so that the precision is satisfied because quantum computers can treat such huge matrix. Our method was applied to a one-variable nonlinear \$\${\textbackslash}dot\{y\}=-\{y\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$\$system to investigate the effect of truncation orders and time step sizes on the computational error. Subsequently, two zero-dimensional homogeneous ignition problems for H2--air and CH4--air gas mixtures were solved. The results revealed that the proposed method could accurately reproduce reference data. Furthermore, an increase in the truncation order improved accuracy with large time-step sizes. Thus, our approach can provide accurate numerical simulations rapidly for complex combustion systems.},

The test is simple and computationally tractable, and it can be applied to short time series. Its main limitation is that it is based on a model of population dynamics that is linear on a logarithmic scale.

Plumbing the wisdom of one of the most popular and successful schools of thought from ancient Rome, philosopher William B. Irvine teaches us to turn any challenge on its head. The Stoic Challenge, then, is the ultimate guide to improving your quality of life through tactics developed by ancient Stoics, from Marcus Aurelius and Seneca to Epictetus.This book uniquely combines ancient Stoic insights with techniques discovered by contemporary psychological research, such as anchoring and framing. The result is a surprisingly simple strategy for dealing with life's unpleasant and unexpected challenges{\texthorizontalbar}from minor setbacks like being caught in a traffic jam or having a flight cancelled to major setbacks like those experienced by physicist Stephen Hawking, who slowly lost the ability to move, and writer Jean-Dominique Bauby, who suffered from locked-in syndrome.The Stoics discovered that thinking of challenges as tests of character can dramatically alter our emotional response to them.

Second, in the study of quantum phase transitions, the fidelity susceptibility has gained prominence as a universal probe of quantum criticality, even for systems that lack an obviously discernible order parameter. Finally, the study of quantum Fisher information in many body systems has seen a surge of interest due to its role as a witness of genuine multipartite entanglement and owing to its utility as a quantifier of quantum resources, in particular those useful in quantum sensing.

In this paper, we derive several extensions of this QSL to closed systems in mixed states. We also compare the strengths of these extensions and examine their tightness. The most widely used extension of the Mandelstam--Tamm QSL originates in Uhlmann's energy dispersion estimate. We carefully analyze the underlying geometry of this estimate, an analysis that makes apparent that the Bures metric, or equivalently the quantum Fisher information, will rarely give rise to tight extensions. This observation leads us to address whether there is a tightest general extension of the Mandelstam--Tamm QSL. Using a geometric construction similar to that developed by Uhlmann, we prove that this is indeed the case. In addition, we show that tight evolutions of mixed states are typically generated by time-varying Hamiltonians, which contrasts with the case for systems in pure states.},

First, the study of topological phases of matter characterized by Chern number is rooted in the symplectic structure of the quantum state space, known in the physics literature as Berry curvature. Second, in the study of quantum phase transitions, the fidelity susceptibility has gained prominence as a universal probe of quantum criticality, even for systems that lack an obviously discernible order parameter. Finally, the study of quantum Fisher information in many body systems has seen a surge of interest due to its role as a witness of genuine multipartite entanglement and owing to its utility as a quantifier of quantum resources, in particular those useful in quantum sensing. Rather than a thorough review, our aim is to connect key results within a common conceptual framework that may serve as an introductory guide to the extensive breadth of applications, and deep mathematical roots, of quantum information geometry, with an intended audience of researchers in quantum many body and condensed matter physics.},

In The PARA Method, Tiago Forte outlines a simple and intuitive four-step system that will help us sort all the information flooding our brains into four major categories---Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives---allowing us to manage our commitments while achieving our goals and dreams. -Projects are specific, short-term efforts that you are actively working on with a certain goal in mind, such as completing a website or renovating your bathroom. -Areas are the larger, ongoing areas of responsibility (health, finances, etc.) that encompass those specific projects. -Resources include content on a range of topics you're interested in or that could be useful for your projects and areas. -Archives include anything from the previous three categories that is now inactive, but you want to save for future reference. With his easy-to-understand and engaging voice, Forte outlines his best practices and tips on how to successfully implement PARA, along with deep dives on everything from how to adopt habits to stay organized to how to use this system to enhance your focus. The PARA Method can be implemented in just seconds but has the power to transform the trajectory of your work and life using the power of digital organization.},

However, regulation in the simple linear model is far from optimal. The negative feedback mechanism whereby the protein ``jams'' the mRNA greatly enhances the effectiveness of the control, with response to perturbation that is targeted, rapid, and metabolically efficient. Understanding the full dynamics of the system phase space is essential to understanding the autoregulation process.},

  abstract = {Transition paths are a uniquely single-molecule property not yet observed for any molecular process in solution. The duration of transition paths is the tiny fraction of the time in an equilibrium single-molecule trajectory when the process actually happens. Here, we report the determination of an upper bound for the transition path time for protein folding from photon-by-photon trajectories. FRET trajectories were measured on single molecules of the dye-labeled, 56-residue 2-state protein GB1, immobilized on a glass surface via a biotin-streptavidin-biotin linkage. Characterization of individual emitted photons by their wavelength, polarization, and absolute and relative time of arrival after picosecond excitation allowed the determination of distributions of FRET efficiencies, donor and acceptor lifetimes, steady state polarizations, and waiting times in the folded and unfolded states. Comparison with the results for freely diffusing molecules showed that immobilization has no detectable effect on the structure or dynamics of the unfolded protein and only a small effect on the folding/unfolding kinetics. Analysis of the photon-by-photon trajectories yields a transition path time {$<$}200 {$\mu$}s, {$>$}10,000 times shorter than the mean waiting time in the unfolded state (the inverse of the folding rate coefficient). Szabo's theory for diffusive transition paths shows that this upper bound for the transition path time is consistent with previous estimates of the Kramers preexponential factor for the rate coefficient, and predicts that the transition path time is remarkably insensitive to the folding rate, with only a 2-fold difference for rate coefficients that differ by 105-fold.},

Nature uses predominantly chemical energy stored in thermodynamically activated, but kinetically stable, molecules. These high-energy molecules are exploited for the synthesis of other biomolecules, for the activation of biological machinery such as pumps and motors, and for the maintenance of structural order. Knowledge of how chemical energy is transferred to biochemical processes is essential for the development of artificial systems with life-like processes. Here, we discuss how chemical energy can be used to control the structural organization of organic molecules. Four different strategies have been identified according to a distinguishable physical-organic basis. For each class, one example from biology and one from chemistry are discussed in detail to illustrate the practical implementation of each concept and the distinct opportunities they offer. Specific attention is paid to the discussion of chemically fueled non-equilibrium self-assembly. We discuss the meaning of non-equilibrium self-assembly, its kinetic origin, and strategies to develop synthetic non-equilibrium systems.},

These models contain many unknown parameters, at least some of which are difficult to measure directly, and instead are estimated by fitting to time-course data. Previous work has suggested that even with precise data sets, many parameters are unknowable by trajectory measurements. We examined this question in the context of a pathway model of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neuronal growth factor (NGF) signaling. Computationally, we examined a palette of experimental perturbations that included different doses of EGF and NGF as well as single and multiple gene knockdowns and overexpressions. While no single experiment could accurately estimate all of the parameters, experimental design methodology identified a set of five complementary experiments that could. These results suggest optimism for the prospects for calibrating even large models, that the success of parameter estimation is intimately linked to the experimental perturbations used, and that experimental design methodology is important for parameter fitting of biological models and likely for the accuracy that can be expected from them.},

These results require a measure on the space of model parameters and we derive and discuss an interpretation of Jeffreys' prior distribution as a uniform prior over the distributions indexed by a family. Finally, we derive a theoretical index of the complexity of a parametric family relative to some true distribution that we call the \{{\textbackslash}it razor\} of the model.

Typically, algorithms get lost in regions of parameter space in which the model is unresponsive to changes in parameters, and one is left to make adjustments by hand. We explain this difficulty by interpreting the fitting process as a generalized interpolation procedure. By considering the manifold of all model predictions in data space, we find that cross sections have a hierarchy of widths and are typically very narrow. Algorithms become stuck as they move near the boundaries. We observe that the model manifold, in addition to being tightly bounded, has low extrinsic curvature, leading to the use of geodesics in the fitting process. We improve the convergence of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm by adding geodesic acceleration to the usual step.},

  abstract = {An outstanding challenge in the field of molecular biology has been to understand the process by which proteins fold into their characteristic three-dimensional structures. Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 {$\mu$}s and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

Key aspects of non-equilibrium physics, however, can be understood with a minimum of formalism based on a rigorous trajectory picture. The fundamental object is the ensemble of trajectories, a set of independent time-evolving systems, which easily can be visualized or simulated (e.g., for protein folding) and which can be analyzed rigorously in analogy to an ensemble of static system configurations. The trajectory picture provides a straightforward basis for understanding first-passage times, ``mechanisms'' in complex systems, and fundamental constraints on the apparent reversibility of complex processes. Trajectories make concrete the physics underlying the diffusion and Fokker--Planck partial differential equations. Last but not least, trajectory ensembles underpin some of the most important algorithms that have provided significant advances in biomolecular studies of protein conformational and binding processes.},

Exploring such quantum-classical correspondences provides a deeper understanding of foundational aspects and has attracted a great deal of attention since the early days of quantum theory. It has been proposed that since a quantum mechanical wave function describes an intrinsic statistical behavior, its classical limit must correspond to a classical ensemble---not to an individual particle. This idea leads us to ask how the uncertainty product of canonical observables in the quantum realm compares with the corresponding dispersions in the classical realm. In this paper, we explore parallels between the uncertainty product of position and momentum in stationary states of quantum systems and the corresponding fluctuations of these observables in the associated classical ensemble. We confine ourselves to one-dimensional conservative systems and show, with the help of suitably defined dimensionless physical quantities, that first and second moments of the canonical observables match with each other in the classical and quantum descriptions---resulting in identical structures for the uncertainty relations in both realms.},

As the scale of the demon increases, so does the ratio of energy saved to energy used by the demon. The amount of energy that can be saved by intervention of intelligence is further limited by the time available for the intervention.

Thus energy can be conserved if a process is performed more slowly, and therefore less irreversibly; or it can be conserved if sufficient information is available to monitor the energy-using device or system. This general relation between time, energy, and information is illustrated by analyses of the optimum size of a cooling tower in a power plant and the optimum thickness of thermal insulation. It is shown that lack of information and the desire to save time often lead to designs that use more energy than the thermodynamic minimum. Economic and political limits to energy conservation are not primarily manufactured by the ''system'' but are imposed by basic facts of engineering and by preferences of most people.},

In traditional optimizations, the experiment consists of input data, model parameters, and cost function. For machine learning and deep learning, the features, labels, and loss function define the experiment. One tool for optimal experimental design is the Fisher information, which gives an estimate of the relative uncertainty in and correlation among the model parameters based on the local curvature of the cost function. Using the Fisher information allows for rapid assessment of many different experimental conditions. In machine learning, the Fisher information can provide guidance as to which types of input features and labels maximize the gradients in the search space. This approach has been applied, for example, to systems biology models of biochemical reaction networks [Transtrum and Qiu, BMC Bioinformatics 13(1), 181 (2012)]. Preliminary application of the Fisher information to optimize experimental design for source localization in an uncertain ocean environment is a step towards finding an efficient machine learning algorithm that produces results with the least uncertainty in the quantities of interest.},

Many such models are ``sloppy,'' i.e., exhibit behavior controlled by a relatively small number of parameter combinations. We review an information theoretic framework for analyzing sloppy models. This formalism is based on the Fisher information matrix, which is interpreted as a Riemannian metric on a parameterized space of models. Distance in this space is a measure of how distinguishable two models are based on their predictions. Sloppy model manifolds are bounded with a hierarchy of widths and extrinsic curvatures. The manifold boundary approximation can extract the simple, hidden theory from complicated sloppy models. We attribute the success of simple effective models in physics as likewise emerging from complicated processes exhibiting a low effective dimensionality. We discuss the ramifications and consequences of sloppy models for biochemistry and science more generally. We suggest that the reason our complex world is understandable is due to the same fundamental reason: simple theories of macroscopic behavior are hidden inside complicated microscopic processes.},

Here we present a transparent example of a Markov model of a molecular motor where lumping leads to a violation of local detailed balance despite a clear timescale separation and hence Markovian dynamics. Driving the system far from equilibrium can lead to a violation of local detailed balance against the driving force. We further show that local detailed balance can be restored, even in the presence of memory, if the coarse-graining is carried out as Milestoning. Our work establishes Milestoning not only as a kinetically but as far as we know for the first time also as a thermodynamically consistent coarse-graining method.

The most widely used extension of the Mandelstam--Tamm QSL originates in Uhlmann's energy dispersion estimate. We carefully analyze the underlying geometry of this estimate, an analysis that makes apparent that the Bures metric, or equivalently the quantum Fisher information, will rarely give rise to tight extensions. This observation leads us to address whether there is a tightest general extension of the Mandelstam--Tamm QSL. Using a geometric construction similar to that developed by Uhlmann, we prove that this is indeed the case. In addition, we show that tight evolutions of mixed states are typically generated by time-varying Hamiltonians, which contrasts with the case for systems in pure states.},

Using these exact quantum speed limits, we can precisely estimate the evolution time for two- and higher-dimensional quantum systems. Additionally, for both finite- and infinite-dimensional quantum systems, we derive an improved Mandelstam-Tamm bound for pure states and show that this bound always saturates for any unitary generated by self-inverse Hamiltonians.

  abstract = {A new and exciting approach to the basics of quantum theory, this undergraduate textbook contains extensive discussions of conceptual puzzles and over 800 exercises and problems. Beginning with three elementary 'qubit' systems, the book develops the formalism of quantum theory, addresses questions of measurement and distinguishability, and explores the dynamics of quantum systems. In addition to the standard topics covered in other textbooks, it also covers communication and measurement, quantum entanglement, entropy and thermodynamics, and quantum information processing. This textbook gives a broad view of quantum theory by emphasizing dynamical evolution, and exploring conceptual and foundational issues. It focuses on contemporary topics, including measurement, time evolution, open systems, quantum entanglement, and the role of information.},

  abstract = {Over the course of the past decade, decoherence has become a ubiquitous scienti?c term popular in all kinds of research, from fundamental theories of quantum physics to applications in nanoengineering. Decoherence has been hailed as the solution to long-standing foundational problems dating back to the beginnings of quantum mechanics. It has been cursed as the key obstacle to next-generation technologies, such as quantum computers (another se- ingly omnipresent ?eld of research). And while decoherence has been directly observed in various experiments, its scope and meaning have often been m- understood and misrepresented. Decoherence makes a fantastic subject of research, as it touches upon many di?erent facets of physics, from phi- sophically inclined questions of interpretation all the way to down-to-earth problems in experimental settings and engineering applications. This book will introduce the reader, in an accessible and self-contained manner, to these various fascinating aspects of decoherence. It will focus in particularontherelationofdecoherencetotheso-calledquantum-to-classical transition, i. e. , the question of how decoherence may explain the emergence of the classical appearance of the macroscopic world around us from the underlying quantum substrate. Thescopeofthisbookisrelativelybroadinordertofamiliarizethereader withthemanyfacetsofdecoherence,inboththetheoreticalandexperimental domains. Throughout the book, I have sought to maintain a healthy balance betweentheconceptualideasassociatedwiththedecoherenceprogramonthe one hand and the formal and mathematical details on the other hand. This book will establish a proper understanding of decoherence as a pure quantum phenomenon and will emphasize the importance of the correct interpretation of the consequences and achievements of decoherence.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms of pattern formation---of which the Turing instability is an archetype---constitute an important class of dynamical processes occurring in biological, ecological, and chemical systems. Recently, it has been shown that the Turing instability can induce pattern formation in discrete media such as complex networks, opening up the intriguing possibility of exploring it as a generative mechanism in a plethora of socioeconomic contexts. Yet much remains to be understood in terms of the precise connection between network topology and its role in inducing the patterns. Here we present a general mathematical description of a two-species reaction-diffusion process occurring on different flavors of network topology. The dynamical equations are of the predator-prey class that, while traditionally used to model species population, has also been used to model competition between antagonistic features in social contexts. We demonstrate that the Turing instability can be induced in any network topology by tuning the diffusion of the competing species or by altering network connectivity. The extent to which the emergent patterns reflect topological properties is determined by a complex interplay between the diffusion coefficients and the localization properties of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We find that networks with large degree fluctuations tend to have stable patterns over the space of initial perturbations, whereas patterns in more homogenous networks are purely stochastic.},

The theory of pattern formation in reaction--diffusion systems defined on symmetric networks has often been investigated, due to its applications in a wide range of disciplines. Here we extend the theory to the case of directed networks, which are found in a number of different fields, such as neuroscience, computer networks and traffic systems. Owing to the structure of the network Laplacian, the dispersion relation has both real and imaginary parts, at variance with the case for a symmetric, undirected network. The homogeneous fixed point can become unstable due to the topology of the network, resulting in a new class of instabilities, which cannot be induced on undirected graphs. Results from a linear stability analysis allow the instability region to be analytically traced. Numerical simulations show travelling waves, or quasi-stationary patterns, depending on the characteristics of the underlying graph.},

In the meantime, we also obtained the critical condition of Turing instability in the network-organized system and found that how the network connection probability and diffusion coefficient affect the reaction-diffusion system of the Brusselator model. In the end, the reason for arising of Turing instability in the Brusselator with the random network was explained. Numerical simulation verified the theoretical results.},

Implementing this kind of non-equilibrium self-assembly process in synthetic systems is bound to profoundly impact the fields of chemistry, materials science and synthetic biology, leading to innovative dissipative structures able to convert and store chemical energy. Yet, despite increasing efforts, the basic principles underlying chemical fuel-driven dissipative self-assembly are often overlooked, generating confusion around the meaning and definition of scientific terms, which does not favour progress in the field. The scope of this Perspective is to bring closer together current experimental approaches and conceptual frameworks. From our analysis it also emerges that chemically fuelled dissipative processes may have played a crucial role in evolutionary processes.},

Following molecular design, we focus on various potential applications of supramolecular hydrogels as molecular biomaterials, classified by their applications in cell cultures, tissue engineering, cell behavior, imaging, and unique applications of hydrogelators. Particularly, we discuss the applications of supramolecular hydrogelators after they form supramolecular assemblies but prior to reaching the critical gelation concentration because this subject is less explored but may hold equally great promise for helping address fundamental questions about the mechanisms or the consequences of the self-assembly of molecules, including low molecular weight ones. Finally, we provide a perspective on supramolecular hydrogelators.

When this density gradient is applied to colour labelled particles, the density distribution decays to a sine curve of fundamental wavelength, which then decays conformally towards a uniform distribution. For conformal relaxation, the dissipation function is found to decay towards equilibrium monotonically, consistent with the predictions of the relaxation theorem. When the system is initiated with a more dramatic density gradient, applied to all particles, non-conformal relaxation is seen in both the dissipation function and the Fourier components of the density distribution. At times, the system appears to be moving away from a uniform density distribution. In both cases, the dissipation function satisfies the modified second law inequality, and the dissipation theorem is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Several contemporaneous image processing and computer vision systems rely upon the full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) measures. The single-scale structural similarity index (SS-SSIM) is one of the most popular measures, and it owes its success to the mathematical simplicity, low computational complexity, and implicit incorporation of Human Visual System's (HVS) characteristics. In this paper, we revise the original parameters of SSIM and its multi-scale counterpart (MS-SSIM) to increase their correlation with subjective evaluation. More specifically, we exploit the evolutionary computation and the swarm intelligence methods on five popular IQA databases, two of which are dedicated distance-changed databases, to determine the best combination of parameters efficiently. Simultaneously, we explore the effect of different scale selection approaches in the context of SS-SSIM. The experimental results show that with a proper fine-tuning (1) the performance of SS-SSIM and MS-SSIM can be improved, in average terms, by 8\% and by 3\%, respectively, (2) the SS-SSIM after the so-called standard scale selection achieves similar performance as if applying computationally more expensive state-of-the-art scale selection methods or MS-SSIM; moreover, (3) there is evidence that the parameters learned on a given database can be successfully transferred to other (previously unseen) databases; finally, (4) we propose a new set of reference parameters for SSIM's variants and provide their interpretation.},

  abstract = {Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been recently applied to materials chemistry to gain fundamental understanding of various reaction and phase transition dynamics at nanometer resolution. However, quantitative extraction of physical and chemical parameters from the liquid-phase TEM videos remains bottlenecked by the lack of automated analysis methods compatible with the videos' high noisiness and spatial heterogeneity. Here, we integrate, for the first time, liquid-phase TEM imaging with our customized analysis framework based on a machine learning model called U-Net neural network. This combination is made possible by our workflow to generate simulated TEM images as the training data with well-defined ground truth. We apply this framework to three typical systems of colloidal nanoparticles, concerning their diffusion and interaction, reaction kinetics, and assembly dynamics, all resolved in real-time and real-space by liquid-phase TEM. A diversity of properties for differently shaped anisotropic nanoparticles are mapped, including the anisotropic interaction landscape of nanoprisms, curvature-dependent and staged etching profiles of nanorods, and an unexpected kinetic law of first-order chaining assembly of concave nanocubes. These systems representing properties at the nanoscale are otherwise experimentally inaccessible. Compared to the prevalent image segmentation methods, U-Net shows a superior capability to predict the position and shape boundary of nanoparticles from highly noisy and fluctuating background---a challenge common and sometimes inevitable in liquid-phase TEM videos. We expect our framework to push the potency of liquid-phase TEM to its full quantitative level and to shed insights, in high-throughput and statistically significant fashion, on the nanoscale dynamics of synthetic and biological nanomaterials.},

  abstract = {The structural similarity index measure (SSIM) is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos.  SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a full reference metric; in other words, the measurement or prediction of image quality is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference. SSIM is a perception-based model that considers image degradation as perceived change in structural information, while also incorporating important perceptual phenomena, including both luminance masking and contrast masking terms.  The difference with other techniques such as MSE or PSNR is that these approaches estimate absolute errors.  Structural information is the idea that the pixels have strong inter-dependencies especially when they are spatially close. These dependencies carry important information about the structure of the objects in the visual scene. Luminance masking is a phenomenon whereby image distortions (in this context) tend to be less visible in bright regions, while contrast masking is a phenomenon whereby distortions become less visible where there is significant activity or "texture" in the image.},

  abstract = {On the basis of suggestive X-ray data, 14 aroyl l-cystine derivatives were designed, synthesized, and examined for their ability to gelate water. Several members of this amino acid family are remarkably effective aqueous gelators (the best being one that can rigidify aqueous solutions at 0.25 mM, ca. 0.01\%, in less than 30 s!). A few of the analogues separate from water as crystals, indicating a close relationship between gelation and crystallization. All effective gelators self-assemble into fibrous structures that entrain the solvent in the capillary spaces among them. Hydrogen-bonding sites on the compounds that might stabilize the fibers were identified from specific substitutions that replace a hydrogen donor with a methyl group, enhance the hydrogen-accepting ability of a carbonyl oxygen, or promote the hydrogen-donating ability of an amide proton. The structural variations were characterized via minimal gelation concentrations and times, X-ray crystallography, light and electron microscopy, rheology, and calorimetry. The multiple techniques, applied to the diverse compounds, allowed an extensive search into the basis of gelation. It was learned, for example, that the compound with the lowest minimum gelator concentration and time also has one of the weakest gels (i.e., it has a low elastic modulus). This is attributed to kinetic effects that perturb the length of the fibers. It was also argued that {$\pi$}/{$\pi$} stacking, the carboxyl carbonyl (but not the carboxyl proton), and solubility factors all contribute to the stability of a fiber. Polymorphism also plays a role. Rheological studies at different temperatures show that certain gels are stable to a 1-Hz, 3-Pa oscillating shear stress at temperatures as high as 90 {$^\circ$}C. Other gels have a ``catastrophic'' break at lower temperatures. Calorimetric data indicate a smooth transition from gel to sol as the temperature is increased. These and other issues are discussed in this ``anatomy'' of a gel.},

Disulfides are also the major products of thiol oxidation, a process that has primary roles in defense mechanisms against oxidative stress and in redox regulation of cell signaling. Although disulfides are relatively stable, their reduction, isomerisation, and interconversion as well as their production reactions are catalyzed by delicate enzyme machineries, providing a dynamic system in biology. Redox homeostasis, a thermodynamic parameter that determines which reactions can occur in cellular compartments, is also balanced by the thiol--disulfide pool. However, it is the kinetic properties of the reactions that best represent cell dynamics, because the partitioning of the possible reactions depends on kinetic parameters. Critical Issues: This review is focused on the kinetics and mechanisms of thiol--disulfide substitution and redox reactions. It summarizes the challenges and advances that are associated with kinetic investigations in small molecular and enzymatic systems from a rigorous chemical perspective using biological examples. The most important parameters that influence reaction rates are discussed in detail. Recent Advances and FutureDirections: Kinetic studies of proteins are more challenging than small molecules, and quite often investigators are forced to sacrifice the rigor of the experimental approach to obtain the important kinetic and mechanistic information. However, recent technological advances allow a more comprehensive analysis of enzymatic systems via using the systematic kinetics apparatus that was developed for small molecule reactions, which is expected to provide further insight into the cell's machinery.

Despite considerable recent efforts, rational design of spatiotemporal patterns in artificial molecular systems remains at an early stage of development. Here, we describe force generation by a propagating wave of supramolecular nanofibers. Inspired by actin dynamics, a reaction network is designed to control the formation and degradation of nanofibers by two chemically orthogonal stimuli. Real-time fluorescent imaging successfully visualizes the propagating wave based on spatiotemporally coupled generation and collapse of nanofibers. Numerical simulation indicates that the concentration gradient of degradation stimulus and the smaller diffusion coefficient of the nanofiber are critical for wave emergence. Moreover, the force (0.005 pN) generated by chemophoresis and/or depletion force of this propagating wave can move nanobeads along the wave direction.},

  abstract = {ConspectusIn biology, the function of many molecules is regulated through nonequilibrium chemical reaction cycles. The prototypical example is the phosphorylation of an amino acid in an enzyme which induces a functional change, e.g., it folds or unfolds, assembles or disassembles, or binds a substrate. Such phosphorylation does not occur spontaneously but requires a phosphorylating agent with high chemical potential (for example, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) to be converted into a molecule with lower chemical potential (adenosine diphosphate (ADP)). When this energy is used to regulate an assembly, we speak of chemically fueled assemblies; i.e., the molecule with high potential, the fuel, is used to regulate a self-assembly process. For example, the binding of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to tubulin induces self-assembly. The bound GTP is hydrolyzed to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) upon assembly, which induces tubulin disassembly. The result is a dynamic assembly endowed with unique characteristics, such as time-dependent behavior and the ability to self-heal.These intriguing, unique properties have inspired supramolecular chemists to create similar chemically fueled molecular assemblies from the bottom up. While examples have been designed, they remain scarce partly because chemically fueled reaction cycles are rare and often complex. Thus, we recently developed a carbodiimide-driven reaction cycle that is versatile and easy to use, quantitatively understood, and does not suffer from side reactions. In the reaction cycle, a carboxylate precursor reacts with a carbodiimide to form an activated species like an anhydride or ester. The activated state reacts with water and thereby reverts to its precursor state; i.e., the activated state is deactivated. Effectively, the precursor catalyzes carbodiimides' conversion into waste and forms a transient activated state.We designed building blocks to regulate a range of assemblies and supramolecular materials at the expense of carbodiimide fuel. The simplicity and versatility of the reaction cycles have democratized and popularized the field of chemically fueled assemblies. In this Account, we describe what we have ``learned'' on our way. We introduce the field exemplified by biological nonequilibrium self-assembly. We describe the design of the carbodiimide-driven reaction cycle. Using examples from our group and others, we offer design rules for the building block's structure and strategies to create the desired morphology or supramolecular materials. The discussed morphologies include fibers, colloids, crystals, and oil- and coacervate-based droplets. We then demonstrate how these assemblies form supramolecular materials with unique material properties like the ability to self-heal. Besides, we discuss the concept of reciprocal coupling in which the assembly exerts feedback on its reaction cycle and we also offer examples of such feedback mechanisms. Finally, we close the Account with a discussion and an outlook on this field. This Account aims to provide our fundamental understanding and facilitate further progress toward conceptually new supramolecular materials.},

Here, we review the microtubule-intrinsic process of dynamic instability, the effect of external factors on this process, and how the resulting forces act on various biological systems.

  abstract = {Dynamic organization of the cell interior, which is crucial for cell function, largely depends on the microtubule cytoskeleton. Microtubules move and position organelles by pushing, pulling, or sliding. Pushing forces can be generated by microtubule polymerization, whereas pulling typically involves microtubule depolymerization or molecular motors, or both. Sliding between a microtubule and another microtubule, an organelle, or the cell cortex is also powered by molecular motors. Although numerous examples of microtubule-based pushing and pulling in living cells have been observed, it is not clear why different cell types and processes employ different mechanisms. This review introduces a classification of microtubule-based positioning strategies and discusses the efficacy of pushing and pulling. The positioning mechanisms based on microtubule pushing are efficient for movements over small distances, and for centering of organelles in symmetric geometries. Mechanisms based on pulling, on the other hand, are typically more elaborate, but are necessary when the distances to be covered by the organelles are large, and when the geometry is asymmetric and complex. Thus, taking into account cell geometry and the length scale of the movements helps to identify general principles of the intracellular layout based on microtubule forces.},

Because of the high water content, soft structure, and porosity of hydrogels, they closely resemble living tissues. Research in recent years shows that hydrogels have been applied in various fields, such as agriculture, biomaterials, the food industry, drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Along with the underlying technology improvements of hydrogel development, hydrogels can be expected to be applied in more fields. Although not all hydrogels have good biodegradability and biocompatibility, such as synthetic hydrogels (polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, polyethylene glycol hydrogels, etc.), their biodegradability and biocompatibility can be adjusted by modification of their functional group or incorporation of natural polymers. Hence, scientists are still interested in the biomedical applications of hydrogels due to their creative adjustability for different uses. In this review, we first introduce the basic information of hydrogels, such as structure, classification, and synthesis. Then, we further describe the recent applications of hydrogels in 3D cell cultures, drug delivery, wound dressing, and tissue engineering.},

  abstract = {Thermodynamic irreversibility is a crucial property of living matter. Irreversible processes maintain spatiotemporally complex structures and functions characteristic of living systems. In high-dimensional biological dynamics, robust and general quantification of irreversibility remains a challenging task due to experimental noise and nonlinear interactions coupling many degrees of freedom. Here we use deep learning to identify tractable, low-dimensional representations of phase-field patterns in a canonical protein signaling process -- the Rho-GTPase system -- as well as complex Ginzburg-Landau dynamics. We show that factorizing variational autoencoder neural networks learn informative pattern features robustly to noise. Resulting neural-network representations reveal signatures of mesoscopic broken detailed balance and time-reversal asymmetry in Rho-GTPase and complex Ginzburg-Landau wave dynamics. Applying the compression-based Ziv-Merhav estimator of irreversibility to representations, we recover irreversibility trends across complex Ginzburg-Landau patterns varying widely in spatiotemporal frequency and noise level. Irreversibility estimates from representations similarly recapitulate cell-activity trends in a Rho-GTPase patterning system undergoing metabolic inhibition. Additionally, we find that our irreversibility estimates serve as a dynamical order parameter, distinguishing stable and chaotic dynamics in these nonlinear systems. Our framework leverages advances in deep learning to offer robust, model-free measurements of nonequilibrium and nonlinear behavior in complex living processes.},

  abstract = {Computers may be thought of as engines for transforming free energy into waste heat and mathematical work. Existing electronic computers dissipate energy vastly in excess of the mean thermal energykT, for purposes such as maintaining volatile storage devices in a bistable condition, synchronizing and standardizing signals, and maximizing switching speed. On the other hand, recent models due to Fredkin and Toffoli show that in principle a computer could compute at finite speed with zero energy dissipation and zero error. In these models, a simple assemblage of simple but idealized mechanical parts (e.g., hard spheres and flat plates) determines a ballistic trajectory isomorphic with the desired computation, a trajectory therefore not foreseen in detail by the builder of the computer. In a classical or semiclassical setting, ballistic models are unrealistic because they require the parts to be assembled with perfect precision and isolated from thermal noise, which would eventually randomize the trajectory and lead to errors. Possibly quantum effects could be exploited to prevent this undesired equipartition of the kinetic energy. Another family of models may be called Brownian computers, because they allow thermal noise to influence the trajectory so strongly that it becomes a random walk through the entire accessible (low-potential-energy) portion of the computer's configuration space. In these computers, a simple assemblage of simple parts determines a low-energy labyrinth isomorphic to the desired computation, through which the system executes its random walk, with a slight drift velocity due to a weak driving force in the direction of forward computation. In return for their greater realism, Brownian models are more dissipative than ballistic ones: the drift velocity is proportional to the driving force, and hence the energy dissipated approaches zero only in the limit of zero speed. In this regard Brownian models resemble the traditional apparatus of thermodynamic thought experiments, where reversibility is also typically only attainable in the limit of zero speed. The enzymatic apparatus of DNA replication, transcription, and translation appear to be nature's closest approach to a Brownian computer, dissipating 20--100kT per step. Both the ballistic and Brownian computers require a change in programming style: computations must be renderedlogically reversible, so that no machine state has more than one logical predecessor. In a ballistic computer, the merging of two trajectories clearly cannot be brought about by purely conservative forces; in a Brownian computer, any extensive amount of merging of computation paths would cause the Brownian computer to spend most of its time bogged down in extraneous predecessors of states on the intended path, unless an extra driving force ofkTln2 were applied (and dissipated) at each merge point. The mathematical means of rendering a computation logically reversible (e.g., creation and annihilation of a history file) will be discussed. The old Maxwell's demon problem is discussed in the light of the relation between logical and thermodynamic reversibility: the essential irreversible step, which prevents the demon from breaking the second law, is not the making of a measurement (which in principle can be done reversibly) but rather the logically irreversible act of erasing the record of one measurement to make room for the next. Converse to the rule that logically irreversible operations on data require an entropy increase elsewhere in the computer is the fact that a tape full of zeros, or one containing some computable pseudorandom sequence such as pi, has fuel value and can be made to do useful thermodynamic work as it randomizes itself. A tape containing an algorithmically random sequence lacks this ability.},

The high sensitivity to external perturbations is explained for systems with and without dissipation. Numerical examples are provided using the dynamics of frictional granular matter. Finally, we point out the relationship of the presently discussed phenomenon to the highly topical issue of ``exceptional points'' in quantum models with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.},

The set of time-ordered sequences of chemical species are one representation of the evolution from reactants to products. However, only a fraction of the possible sequences is typical, having the majority of the joint probability and characterizing the succession of chemical nonequilibrium states. Here, we extend a variational measure of typicality and apply it to atomistic simulations of a model for hydrogen oxidation over a range of temperatures. We demonstrate an information-theoretic methodology to identify typical sequences under the constraints of mass conservation. Including these constraints leads to an improved ability to learn the chemical sequence mechanism from experimentally accessible data. From these typical sequences, we show that two quantities defining the variational typical set of sequences---the joint entropy rate and the topological entropy rate---increase linearly with temperature. These results suggest that, away from explosion limits, data over a narrow range of thermodynamic parameters could be sufficient to extrapolate these typical features of combustion chemistry to other conditions.},

This demonstration relies on the finding that, in explosive regimes, these trajectories have the quantitative features of a dynamical phase transition. Through computer simulations for both a generic and a reduced model for hydrogen oxidation, we find only one dominant reactive phase at temperatures below the explosion limits. At temperatures above the limits, however, a second phase transiently emerges from the chemistry. By locating the pseudo-critical temperature where two reactive phases are distinguishable, we construct all three explosion-limit boundaries for model hydrogen--oxygen mixtures of finite size.},

Such non-monotonic dynamics are in principle possible even in a linear model if the matrix defining the model is non-normal, as characterized by a necessarily non-orthogonal set of eigenvectors. However, the extent to which non-normality is responsible for non-monotonic behavior remains an open question. Here, using a master equation to model the reaction dynamics, we derive a general condition for observing non-monotonic dynamics of individual species, establishing that non-normality promotes non-monotonicity but is not a requirement for it. In contrast, we show that non-normality is a requirement for non-monotonic dynamics to be observed in the R{\'e}nyi entropy. Using hydrogen combustion as an example application, we demonstrate that non-monotonic dynamics under experimental conditions are supported by a linear chain of connected components, at variance with the dominance of a single giant component observed in typical random reaction networks. The exact linearity of the master equation enables development of a rigorous theory and simulations for dynamical networks of unprecedented sizes (approaching 105 dynamical variables, even for a network of only 20 reactions and involving less than 100 atoms). Our conclusions are expected to hold for other combustion processes, and the general theory we develop is applicable to all chemical reaction networks, including biological ones.},

However, predicting the evolution of density from atomic and molecular scale dynamics is challenging for nonsteady, open, and driven nonequilibrium processes. Here, we establish a theory to address this challenge for classical dynamical systems that is analogous to the density matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. We show that a classical density matrix is similar to the phase-space metric and evolves in time according to generalizations of Liouville's theorem and Liouville's equation for non-Hamiltonian systems. The traditional Liouvillian forms are recovered in the absence of dissipation or driving by imposing trace preservation or by considering Hamiltonian dynamics. Local measures of dynamical instability and chaos are embedded in classical commutators and anticommutators and directly related to Poisson brackets when the dynamics are Hamiltonian. Because the classical density matrix is built from the Lyapunov vectors that underlie classical chaos, it offers an alternative computationally tractable basis for the statistical mechanics of nonequilibrium processes that applies to systems that are driven, transient, dissipative, regular, and chaotic.},

Are there analogous dynamic scaling laws that are unique to the chemical reaction mechanisms available synthetically and occurring naturally? Here, we formulate an approach to the dynamic scaling of stochastic fluctuations in thermodynamic observables at and away from equilibrium. Both analytical expressions and numerical simulations confirm our dynamic scaling ansatz with associated scaling exponents, function, and law. A survey of common chemical mechanisms reveals classes that organize according to the molecularity of the reactions involved, the nature of the reaction vessel and external reservoirs, (non)equilibrium conditions, and the extent of autocatalysis in the reaction network. Varying experimental parameters, such as temperature, can cause coupled reactions capable of chemical feedback to transition between these classes. While path observables, such as the dynamical activity, have scaling exponents that are time-independent, the variance in the entropy production and flow can have time-dependent scaling exponents and self-averaging properties as a result of temporal correlations that emerge during thermodynamically irreversible processes. Altogether, these results establish dynamic universality classes in the nonequilibrium fluctuations of thermodynamic observables for well-mixed chemical reactions.},

Near equilibrium, thermodynamic intuition suggests that fast irreversible processes will dissipate more energy and entropy than slow quasistatic processes connecting the same initial and final states. For small systems, recently discovered thermodynamic speed limits suggest that faster processes will dissipate more than slower processes. Here, we test the hypothesis that this relationship between speed and dissipation holds for stochastic paths far from equilibrium. To analyze stochastic paths on finite timescales, we derive an exact expression for the path probabilities of continuous-time Markov chains from the path summation solution to the master equation. We present a minimal model for a driven system in which relative energies of the initial and target states control the speed, and the nonequilibrium currents of a cycle control the dissipation. Although the hypothesis holds near equilibrium, we find that faster processes can dissipate less under far-from-equilibrium conditions because of strong currents. This model serves as a minimal prototype for designing kinetics to sculpt the nonequilibrium path space so that faster paths produce less dissipation.},

Answering this question requires a quantitative understanding of when we can improve performance and speed while minimizing the dissipative losses associated with operating in a fluctuating environment. Here, we show that there are four modalities for optimizing dynamical functions that can guide the design of nanoscale systems. We analyze Markov models that span the design space: a clock, ratchet, replicator, and self-assembling system. Using stochastic thermodynamics and an exact expression for path probabilities, we classify these models of dynamical functions based on the correlation of speed with dissipation and with the chosen performance metric. We also analyze random networks to identify the model features that affect their classification and the optimization of their functionality.

  abstract = {External flows of energy, entropy, and matter can cause sudden transitions in the stability of biological and industrial systems, fundamentally altering their dynamical function. How might we control and design these transitions in chemical reaction networks? Here, we analyze transitions giving rise to complex behavior in random reaction networks subject to external driving forces. In the absence of driving, we characterize the uniqueness of the steady state and identify the percolation of a giant connected component in these networks as the number of reactions increases. When subject to chemical driving (influx and outflux of chemical species), the steady state can undergo bifurcations, leading to multistability or oscillatory dynamics. By quantifying the prevalence of these bifurcations, we show how chemical driving and network sparsity tend to promote the emergence of these complex dynamics and increased rates of entropy production. We show that catalysis also plays an important role in the emergence of complexity, strongly correlating with the prevalence of bifurcations. Our results suggest that coupling a minimal number of chemical signatures with external driving can lead to features present in biochemical processes and abiogenesis.},

  abstract = {Fisher information is a lower bound on the uncertainty in the statistical estimation of classical and quantum mechanical parameters. While some deterministic dynamical systems are not subject to random fluctuations, they do still have a form of uncertainty. Infinitesimal perturbations to the initial conditions can grow exponentially in time, a signature of deterministic chaos. As a measure of this uncertainty, we introduce another classical information, specifically for the deterministic dynamics of isolated, closed, or open classical systems not subject to noise. This classical measure of information is defined with Lyapunov vectors in tangent space, making it less akin to the classical Fisher information and more akin to the quantum Fisher information defined with wavevectors in Hilbert space. Our analysis of the local state space structure and linear stability leads to upper and lower bounds on this information, giving it an interpretation as the net stretching action of the flow. Numerical calculations of this information for illustrative mechanical examples show that it depends directly on the phase space curvature and speed of the flow.},

Endogenous embedded semiflexible filaments such as microtubules, or added filaments such as single-walled carbon nanotubes are used as novel tools to noninvasively track equilibrium and nonequilibrium fluctuations in such biopolymer networks. Here, we analytically calculate shape fluctuations of semiflexible probe filaments in a viscoelastic environment, driven out of equilibrium by motor activity. Transverse bending fluctuations of the probe filaments can be decomposed into dynamic normal modes. We find that these modes no longer evolve independently under nonequilibrium driving. This effective mode coupling results in nonzero circulatory currents in a conformational phase space, reflecting a violation of detailed balance. We present predictions for the characteristic frequencies associated with these currents and investigate how the temporal signatures of motor activity determine mode correlations, which we find to be consistent with recent experiments on microtubules embedded in cytoskeletal networks.},

In a reaction with the chemical fuel, the nanoparticles are chemically activated to a state that favors assembling into clusters. The activated state is metastable and decays to the original precursor reversing the assembly. The dynamic interplay of activation and deactivation results in a material of which the behavior is regulated by the amount of fuel added to the system; they either did not assemble, assembled transiently, or assembled permanently in kinetically trapped clusters. Because of the irreversibility of the kinetically trapped clusters, we found that the behavior of the self-assembly was prone to hysteresis effects. The final state of the system in the energy landscape depended on the pathway of preparation. For example, when a large amount of fuel was added at once, the material would end up kinetically trapped in a local minimum. When the same amount of fuel was added in small batches with sufficient time for the system to re-equilibrate, the final state would be the global minimum. A better understanding of pathway complexity in the energy landscape is crucial for the development of fuel-driven supramolecular materials.},

We show that energy dissipation can enhance phase sensitivity linearly by driving the phase-amplitude coupling and increase timing accuracy by suppressing phase diffusion. Two general design principles in the key underlying reaction loop formed by two antiparallel pathways are found to optimize oscillation performance with a given energy budget: balancing the forward-to-backward flux ratio between the two pathways to reduce phase diffusion and maximizing the net flux of the phase-advancing pathway relative to that of the phase-retreating pathway to enhance phase sensitivity. Experimental evidences consistent with these design principles are found in the circadian clock of cyanobacteria. Future experiments to test the predicted dependence of phase sensitivity on energy dissipation are proposed.},

  abstract = {Systems coupled to multiple thermodynamic reservoirs can exhibit nonequilibrium dynamics, breaking detailed balance to generate currents. To power these currents, the entropy of the reservoirs increases. The rate of entropy production, or dissipation, is a measure of the statistical irreversibility of the nonequilibrium process. By measuring this irreversibility in several biological systems, recent experiments have detected that particular systems are not in equilibrium. Here we discuss three strategies to replace binary classification (equilibrium versus nonequilibrium) with a quantification of the entropy production rate. To illustrate, we generate time-series data for the evolution of an analytically tractable bead-spring model. Probability currents can be inferred and utilized to indirectly quantify the entropy production rate, but this approach requires prohibitive amounts of data in high-dimensional systems. This curse of dimensionality can be partially mitigated by using the thermodynamic uncertainty relation to bound the entropy production rate using statistical fluctuations in the probability currents.},

Data from Vanderbilt University Medical School's biomedical umbrella program were used to test to what extent GRE scores can predict outcomes in graduate school training when controlling for other admissions information. Overall, the GRE did not prove useful in predicating who will graduate with a Ph.D., pass the qualifying exam, have a shorter time to defense, deliver more conference presentations, publish more first author papers, or obtain an individual grant or fellowship. GRE scores were found to be moderate predictors of first semester grades, and weak to moderate predictors of graduate GPA and some elements of a faculty evaluation. These findings suggest admissions committees of biomedical doctoral programs should consider minimizing their reliance on GRE scores to predict the important measures of progress in the program and student productivity.},

Here many aspect of ridge regression are reviewed e.g. moments, mean squared error, its equivalence to constrained estimation, and its relation to Bayesian regression. Finally, its behaviour and use are illustrated in simulation and on omics data. Subsequently, ridge regression is generalized to allow for a more general penalty. The ridge penalization framework is then translated to logistic regression and its properties are shown to carry over. To contrast ridge penalized estimation, the final chapters introduce its lasso counterpart and generalizations thereof.},

In many potential applications of hydrogels, such as stretchable conductors, ionic cables, and neuroprostheses, the thermal conductivities of hydrogels should be understood clearly. In the present work, we build molecular dynamics (MD) models of random cross-linked polyacrylamide hydrogels with different water volume fractions through a reaction method. On the basis of these models, thermal conductivities of hydrogels at the nanoscale are investigated by a none-equilibrium MD method. This work reveals that when the water fraction of hydrogels is under 85\%, the thermal conductivity increases with the water fraction, and can be even higher than the thermal conductivities of both pure polymer networks and pure water because of the influence of the interface between polymer networks and water. However, when the water fraction in hydrogels is bigger than 85\%, its thermal conductivity will decrease and get close to the water's conductivity. Accordingly, to explain this abnormal phenomenon, a 2-order-3-phase theoretical model is proposed by considering hydrogel as a 3-phase composite. It can be found that the proposed theory can predict results which agree quite well with our simulated results.},

  abstract = {Emulsions consisting of droplets immersed in a fluid are typically unstable since they coarsen over time. One important coarsening process is Ostwald ripening, which is driven by the surface tension of the droplets. Stability of emulsions is relevant not only in complex fluids but also in biological cells, which contain liquidlike compartments, e.g., germ granules, Cajal bodies, and centrosomes. Such cellular systems are driven away from equilibrium, e.g., by chemical reactions, and thus can be called active emulsions. In this paper, we study such active emulsions by developing a coarse-grained description of the droplet dynamics, which we analyze for two different chemical reaction schemes. We first consider the simple case of first-order reactions, which leads to stable, monodisperse emulsions in which Ostwald ripening is suppressed within a range of chemical reaction rates. We then consider autocatalytic droplets, which catalyze the production of their own droplet material. Spontaneous nucleation of autocatalytic droplets is strongly suppressed and their emulsions are typically unstable. We show that autocatalytic droplets can be nucleated reliably and their emulsions stabilized by the help of chemically active cores, which catalyze the production of droplet material. In summary, different reaction schemes and catalytic cores can be used to stabilize emulsions and to control their properties.},

  abstract = {The Fisher information matrix is a quantity of fundamental importance for information geometry and asymptotic statistics. In practice, it is widely used to quickly estimate the expected information available in a data set and guide experimental design choices. In many modern applications, it is intractable to analytically compute the Fisher information and Monte Carlo methods are used instead. The standard Monte Carlo method produces estimates of the Fisher information that can be biased when the Monte-Carlo noise is non-negligible. Most problematic is noise in the derivatives as this leads to an overestimation of the available constraining power, given by the inverse Fisher information. In this work we find another simple estimate that is oppositely biased and produces an underestimate of the constraining power. This estimator can either be used to give approximate bounds on the parameter constraints or can be combined with the standard estimator to give improved, approximately unbiased estimates. Both the alternative and the combined estimators are asymptotically unbiased so can be also used as a convergence check of the standard approach. We discuss potential limitations of these estimators and provide methods to assess their reliability. These methods accelerate the convergence of Fisher forecasts, as unbiased estimates can be achieved with fewer Monte Carlo samples, and so can be used to reduce the simulated data set size by several orders of magnitude.},

Especially, it is proven that the presence of an autocatalytic reaction is not a necessary condition for a violation of the thermodynamic stability condition. It turns out that every reaction with at least one variable reactant at each side of the reaction equation can potentially destabilize the steady states. An explicit example of a simple reaction system without autocatalytic reactions where the stability of the steady state changes via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation is discussed. Furthermore, in expanding the original concept for proving local stability to global stability analyses, a general way for constructing different Lyapunov functions is given.},

Probability currents provide such a measure in terms of the rate at which they enclose area in phase space. We measure this area enclosing rate for trapped colloidal particles, where only one particle is driven. By combining experiment, theory, and simulation, we single out the effect of the different time scales in the system on the measured probability currents. In this controlled experimental setup, particles interact hydrodynamically. These interactions lead to a strong spatial dependence of the probability currents and to a local influence of athermal agitation. In a multiple-particle system, we show that even when the driving acts only on one particle, probability currents occur between other, non-driven particles. This may have significant implications for the interpretation of fluctuations in biological systems containing elastic networks in addition to a suspending fluid.},

  abstract = {Synthetic chemistry has traditionally relied on reactions between reactants of high chemical potential and transformations that proceed energetically downhill to either a global or local minimum (thermodynamic or kinetic control). Catalysts can be used to manipulate kinetic control, lowering activation energies to influence reaction outcomes. However, such chemistry is still constrained by the shape of one-dimensional reaction coordinates. Coupling synthesis to an orthogonal energy input can allow ratcheting of chemical reaction outcomes, reminiscent of the ways that molecular machines ratchet random thermal motion to bias conformational dynamics. This fundamentally distinct approach to synthesis allows multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces to be navigated, enabling reaction outcomes that cannot be achieved under conventional kinetic or thermodynamic control. In this Review, we discuss how ratcheted synthesis is ubiquitous throughout biology and consider how chemists might harness ratchet mechanisms to accelerate catalysis, drive chemical reactions uphill and programme complex reaction sequences.},

  abstract = {Maxwell's Demon is a thought experiment devised by J. C. Maxwell in 1867 in order to show that the Second Law of thermodynamics is not universal, since it has a counter-example. Since the Second Law is taken by many to provide an arrow of time, the threat to its universality threatens the account of temporal directionality as well. Various attempts to ``exorcise'' the Demon, by proving that it is impossible for one reason or another, have been made throughout the years, but none of them were successful. We have shown (in a number of publications) by a general state-space argument that Maxwell's Demon is compatible with classical mechanics, and that the most recent solutions, based on Landauer's thesis, are not general. In this paper we demonstrate that Maxwell's Demon is also compatible with quantum mechanics. We do so by analyzing a particular (but highly idealized) experimental setup and proving that it violates the Second Law. Our discussion is in the framework of standard quantum mechanics; we give two separate arguments in the framework of quantum mechanics with and without the projection postulate. We address in our analysis the connection between measurement and erasure interactions and we show how these notions are applicable in the microscopic quantum mechanical structure. We discuss what might be the quantum mechanical counterpart of the classical notion of ``macrostates'', thus explaining why our Quantum Demon setup works not only at the micro level but also at the macro level, properly understood. One implication of our analysis is that the Second Law cannot provide a universal lawlike basis for an account of the arrow of time; this account has to be sought elsewhere.},

However, any thermodynamic system can exhibit fluctuations in which negative entropy production may be observed. In particular, in stochastic quantum processes due to quantum correlations and also memory effects we may see the reversal energy flow (heat flow from the cold system to the hot system) and the backflow of information into the system that leads to the negativity of the entropy production which is an apparent violation of the Second Law. In order to resolve this apparent violation, we will try to properly extend the Second Law to quantum processes by incorporating information explicitly into the Second Law. We will also provide a thermodynamic operational meaning for the flow and backflow of information. Finally, it is shown that negative and positive entropy production can be described by a quantum thermodynamic force.},

In this paper, we study the chemo-mechanical coupling that leads to the self-propulsion of chemically active colloids. The coupling between chemical reactions and momentum transport is a consequence of Onsager reciprocal relations. They state that the velocity and the surface reaction rate are related to mechanical and chemical affinities through a symmetric matrix. A consequence of Onsager reciprocal relations is that if a chemical reaction drives the motion of the colloid, then an external force generates a reaction rate. Here, we investigate Onsager reciprocal relations for a spherical active colloid that catalyzes a reversible surface chemical reaction between two species. We solve the relevant transport equations using a perturbation expansion and numerical simulations to demonstrate the validity of reciprocal relations around the equilibrium. Our results are consistent with previous studies and highlight the key role of solute advection in preserving the symmetry of the Onsager matrix. Finally, we show that Onsager reciprocal relations break down around a nonequilibrium steady state, which has implications for the thermal fluctuations of the active colloids used in experiments.},

Here, we use a simple, analytically solvable, one-dimensional bistable chemical system to demonstrate the validity of the maximum entropy production principle. To generalize to multistable stochastic system, we use the stochastic least-action principle to derive the entropy production and its role in the stability of nonequilibrium steady states. This shows that in a multistable system, all else being equal, the steady state with the highest entropy production is favored, with a number of implications for the evolution of biological, physical, and geological systems.},

However, accurately quantifying structural changes that occur on the electrode and subsequently correlating them to the applied stimulus remains challenging. Here, we present structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) analysis as segmentation-free video processing algorithm for locally detecting and quantifying structural change occurring in LCTEM videos. In this study, DSSIM analysis is applied to two in-situ LCTEM videos to demonstrate how to implement this algorithm and interpret the results. We show DSSIM analysis can be used as a visualization tool for qualitative data analysis by highlighting structural changes which are easily missed when viewing the raw data. Furthermore, we demonstrate how DSSIM analysis can serve as a quantitative metric and efficiently convert 3-dimensional microscopy videos to 1-dimenional plots which makes it easy to interpret and compare events occurring at different timepoints in a video. In the analyses presented here, DSSIM is used to directly correlate the magnitude and temporal scale of structural change to the features of the applied electrical bias. ImageJ, Python, and MATLAB programs, including a user-friendly interface and accompanying documentation, are published alongside this manuscript to make DSSIM analysis easily accessible to the scientific community.},

In such systems, a NESS can be reached with the help of an externally driven pump for which we introduce a simple model. The crucial parameters are the pumping rate and the finite size of the chemical reservoir. We apply this model to a simple biochemical oscillator, the Brusselator, and quantify the performance using the number of coherent oscillations. As a surprising result, we find that higher precision can be achieved with finite-size reservoirs even though the corresponding current fluctuations are larger than in the ideal infinite case.},

It is revealed that the extremal trends of entropy production for these cases are regime-dependent. In the monostable regime without heterogeneous structures, the steady state follows the minimization of entropy production. For the bistable uniform regime, the steady state with higher entropy production prevails over that with lower entropy production. As to the heterogeneous states that emerge around the bifurcation curves, the entropy production varies in both space and time, showing alternate appearance of states corresponding to minimum and maximum values of entropy production, respectively. The spatiotemporal compromise between maximization and minimization of entropy production appears to govern the corresponding steady states in different regimes.},

  abstract = {The concept of entropy has been pivotal in the formulation of thermodynamics. For systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, a comparable role is played by entropy production and dissipation. Here we provide a comprehensive picture how local dissipation due to effective chemical events manifests on large scales in active matter. We start from a microscopic model for a single catalytic particle involving explicit solute molecules and show that it undergoes directed motion. Leveraging stochastic thermodynamics, we calculate the average entropy production rate for interacting particles. We then show how the model of active Brownian particles emerges in a certain limit and we determine the entropy production rate on the level of the hydrodynamic equations. Our results augment the model of active Brownian particles with rigorous expressions for the dissipation that cannot be inferred from their equations of motion, and we illustrate consequences for wall aggregation and motility-induced phase separation. Notably, our bottom-up approach reveals that a naive application of the Onsager currents yields an incorrect expression for the local dissipation.},

To appreciate why, we first state the problem, outline historical approaches, and survey the present state of the physics of self-organization. This frames the particular challenges arising from mathematical intractability and the resulting need for computational approaches, as well as those arising from a chronic failure to define structure. Then, an overview of two modern mathematical formulations of organization -- intrinsic computation and evolution operators -- lays out a way to overcome these challenges. Together, the vantage point they afford shows how to account for the emergence of structured states via a statistical mechanics of systems arbitrarily far from equilibrium. The result is a constructive path forward to principles of organization that builds on mathematical identification of structure.},

While this is common for unbiased estimators, a bias does often occur in practice. The performance analysis of biased estimators is more difficult, because the bias has to be taken into account additionally. Furthermore, not the behavior of the biased estimator is finally of interest in measurements, but the behavior of its bias-corrected counterpart. In order to simplify the required performance analysis for biased estimators, the relation between the efficiencies of the biased and the bias-corrected estimator is derived. As result, both efficiencies are shown to be (at least asymptotically) identical. Hence, the bias-corrected estimator attains the Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound if and only if the biased estimator attains its Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound. Furthermore, the mean square errors become minimal if and only if the estimators reach the Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound. Consequently, the optimality of the bias-corrected estimator can also be judged by evaluating the mean square error of the biased estimator.},

It remains poorly understood how biochemical circuits suppress these phase fluctuations and what is the incurred thermodynamic cost. Here, we study three different types of biochemical oscillation, representing three basic oscillation motifs shared by all known oscillatory systems. In all the systems studied, we find that the phase diffusion constant depends on the free-energy dissipation per period, following the same inverse relation parameterized by system-specific constants. This relationship and its range of validity are shown analytically in a model of noisy oscillation. Microscopically, we find that the oscillation is driven by multiple irreversible cycles that hydrolyse fuel molecules such as ATP; the number of phase coherent periods is proportional to the free energy consumed per period. Experimental evidence in support of this general relationship and testable predictions are also presented.},

  abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation--dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

  abstract = {Resilience is a component of ecological stability; it is assessed as the rate at which perturbations to a stable ecological system decay. The most frequently used estimate of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to infinity. However, in the short term, perturbations can grow significantly before they decay, and eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum amplification (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation), and the time at which this amplification occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the flow of elements through a tropical rain forest) and a standard nonlinear predator-prey model. Each of these models exhibits transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability. Measures of relative stability that ignore transient growth will often give a misleading picture of the response to a perturbation.},

Several examples of the amplification of intrinsic fluctuations by chaos in classical dissipative systems are given in support of 1). In support of 2), the quantum signature of classical chaos is established using Husimi-Wigner distributions that have precise classical analogues in classical phase space. (Related effects exist for discrete maps when described by the Frobenius-Perron operator perspective.) The best way to construct these Husimi-Wigner distributions is to use generalized coherent states. Following a development by John Klauder, generalized Gaussian coherent states were constructed. These new coherent states have applications for systems as diverse as Rydberg atom electrons and a particle in a box. This presentation reviews the progression of ideas that led to these results.},

We develop a rigorous thermodynamic theory of reaction diffusion systems to characterize chemical waves. Our main result consists of defining the proper thermodynamic potential of the local dynamics as a nonequilibrium free energy density and establishing its balance equation. This enables us to identify the dynamics of the free energy, of the dissipation, and of the work spent to sustain the wave propagation. Two prototypical classes of chemical waves are examined. From a thermodynamic perspective, the first is sustained by relaxation toward equilibrium and the second by nonconservative forces generated by chemostats. We analytically study step-like waves, called wavefronts, using the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation as a representative of the first class and oscillating waves in the Brusselator model as a representative of the second. Given the fundamental role of chemical waves as message carriers in biosystems, our thermodynamic theory constitutes an important step toward an understanding of information transfers and processing in biology.},

  abstract = {In this work we continue the study of pattern formations and dissipation of energy and matter initiated in the previous papers by using hyperbolic reaction-diffusion equations for reacting systems. In this paper, two-dimensional hyperbolic reaction-diffusion equations are numerically solved for the Selkov model. It is shown that the evolution equations used can give rise to various kinds of patterns such as hexagonal structures, stripes, spirals, maze structures, chaotic structures, etc., depending on the values of the reaction-diffusion number Nrd and the initial and boundary conditions. Random initial conditions are shown to give rise to patterns which evolve to break symmetry and form a new series of patterns. Solitary waves are also observed. The entropy production (equivalently, the calortropy production for the approximations made) is studied for various patterns formed and its characteristic features are observed to be related to the patterns. As is the case of one-dimensional hyperbolic reaction-diffusion equations reported earlier, the values of the entropy production computed indicate that the system maintains the particular organized local structures at the expense of energy and matter on the part of other modes, and the global energy and matter dissipation is the same for all patterns formed. However, when the system produces a chaotic pattern, the entropy production is lower than the locally organized structures. The amplitude equations are derived and compared for the hyperbolic and parabolic reaction-diffusion equations. Except for the coefficients in the equations the basic structures are the same regardless of their precursor equations. Hyperbolic reaction-diffusion equations appear to be better suited for description of transient structures and richer in variety of patterns than the corresponding parabolic differential equations to which the former reduce in the limit of high reaction-diffusion number.},

  abstract = {Nature has an extraordinary capacity to precisely regulate the chemical reactivity in a highly complex mixture of molecules that is present in the cell. External stimuli lead to transient up- and downregulation of chemical reactions and provide a means for a cell to process information arriving from the environment. The development of synthetic chemical systems with life-like properties requires strategies that allow likewise control over chemical reactivity in a complex environment. Here, we show a synthetic system that mimics the initial steps that take place when a natural signal transduction pathway is activated. Monophosphate nucleosides act as chemical triggers for the self-assembly of nanoreactors that upregulate chemical reactions between reagents present at low micromolar concentrations. Different nucleotides template different assemblies and hence activate different pathways, thus establishing a distinct connection between input and output molecules. Trigger-induced upregulation of chemical reactivity occurs for only a limited amount of time because the chemical triggers are gradually removed from the system by enzymes. It is shown that the same system transiently produces different output molecules depending on the chemical input that is provided.},

These structures form through two simultaneous reactions, forward and backward, which generate and consume a molecule that undergoes self-assembly. The dynamics of these assembly processes have been shown to differ from conventional thermodynamically stable molecular assemblies. However, the evolution of nanoscale morphologies in chemically driven self-assembly and how they compare to conventional assemblies has not been resolved. Here, we use a chemically driven redox system to separately carry out the forward and backward reactions. We analyze the forward and backward reactions both sequentially and synchronously with time-resolved cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoEM). Quantitative image analysis shows that the synchronous process is more complex and heterogeneous than the sequential process. Our key finding is that a thermodynamically unstable stacked nanorod phase, briefly observed in the backward reaction, is sustained for {$\sim$}6 hours in the synchronous process. Kinetic Monte Carlo modeling show that the synchronous process is driven by multiple cycles of assembly and disassembly. The collective data suggest that chemically driven self-assembly can create sustained morphologies not seen in thermodynamically stable assemblies by kinetically stabilizing transient intermediates. This finding provides plausible design principles to develop and optimize supramolecular materials with novel properties.},

In recent years, increasing efforts have been made to couple chemical reactions to molecular self-assembly, with the aim of creating supramolecular materials with lifelike properties and functions. In this feature article, after summarising the work of chemical reaction mediated supramolecular hydrogels, we first focus on a typical example where dynamic self-assembly of molecular hydrogels is activated by in situ formation of a hydrazone bond in water. We discuss how the formation of the hydrazone-based supramolecular hydrogels can be controlled in time and space. After that, we describe transient assembly of supramolecular hydrogels powered by out-of-equilibrium chemical reaction networks regulated by chemical fuels, which show unique properties such as finite lifetime, dynamic structures, and regenerative capabilities. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future investigations that need to be done urgently, which range from fundamental research to real-life applications of dynamic supramolecular hydrogels.},

It is becoming clear, however, that thermal relaxation is much more intricate when temperature changes push the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, by using an optically trapped colloidal particle, we show that microscale systems under such conditions heat up faster than they cool down. We find that between any pair of temperatures, heating is not only faster than cooling but the respective processes, in fact, evolve along fundamentally distinct pathways, which we explain with a new theoretical framework that we call thermal kinematics. Our results change the view of thermalization at the microscale and will have a strong impact on energy-conversion applications and thermal management of microscopic devices, particularly in the operation of Brownian heat engines.},

They play a key role in photonics, underpinning technologies from mode-locked lasers to microresonator optical frequency combs. Here we report on experimental observations of spontaneous symmetry breaking of dissipative optical solitons. Our experiments are performed in a nonlinear optical ring resonator, where dissipative solitons arise in the form of persisting pulses of light known as Kerr cavity solitons. We engineer symmetry between two orthogonal polarization modes of the resonator and show that the solitons of the system can spontaneously break this symmetry, giving rise to two distinct but co-existing vectorial solitons with mirror-like, asymmetric polarization states. We also show that judiciously applied perturbations allow for deterministic switching between the two symmetry-broken dissipative soliton states. Our work delivers fundamental insights at the intersection of multi-mode nonlinear optical resonators, dissipative structures, and spontaneous symmetry breaking, and expands upon our understanding of dissipative solitons in coherently driven Kerr resonators.},

While this phenomenon was thoroughly studied in spatially extended systems, temporally localized states are gaining attention only recently, driven primarily by applications from fiber or semiconductor lasers. Here we present a theory for temporal dissipative solitons (TDS) in systems with time-delayed feedback. In particular, we derive a system with an advanced argument, which determines the profile of the TDS. We also provide a complete classification of the spectrum of TDS into interface and pseudocontinuous spectrum. We illustrate our theory with two examples: a generic delayed phase oscillator, which is a reduced model for an injected laser with feedback, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron with delayed feedback. Finally, we discuss possible destabilization mechanisms of TDS and show an example where the TDS delocalizes and its pseudocontinuous spectrum develops a modulational instability.},

Here we demonstrate that quasi-solitons can be robustly observed in excitable systems with excitable kinetics and with self-diffusion only. This includes quasi-solitons of fixed shape (like KdV solitons) or envelope quasi-solitons (like NLS solitons). This can happen in systems with more than two components, and can be explained by effective cross-diffusion, which emerges via adiabatic elimination of a fast but diffusing component.

Our main result consists of defining the proper thermodynamic potential of the local dynamics as a nonequilibrium free energy density and establishing its balance equation. This enables us to identify the dynamics of the free energy, of the dissipation, and of the work spent to sustain the wave propagation. Two prototypical classes of chemical waves are examined. From a thermodynamic perspective, the first is sustained by relaxation toward equilibrium and the second by nonconservative forces generated by chemostats. We analytically study step-like waves, called wavefronts, using the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation as a representative of the first class and oscillating waves in the Brusselator model as a representative of the second. Given the fundamental role of chemical waves as message carriers in biosystems, our thermodynamic theory constitutes an important step toward an understanding of information transfers and processing in biology.},

To shed light on the stationary properties of such systems, we consider paradigmatic systems of nonreciprocally coupled active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles. For each system, we uniquely decompose the interparticle force into an energy gradient and a transverse nonconservative force. We show that the steady-state distribution of positions, which would only reflect the energy if the noise were thermal, features the transverse force as an effective potential that stabilizes the energy minima, due to the persistent noise that propels the particles. We exactly solve the distribution for nonreciprocal harmonic oscillators and numerically verify the effective stability for systems with more complex couplings. Our work suggests that energy injection at the single-particle level controls how, if at all, nonreciprocity in the interactions appears in stationary states of active matter.},

  abstract = {We deal with a system of Lotka--Volterra competition-diffusion equations on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$, which is a competing two species model with diffusion. It is known that the equations allow traveling waves with monotone profile. In this article we prove the existence of an entire solution which behaves as two monotone waves propagating from both sides of the x-axis, where an entire solution is meant by a classical solution defined for all space and time variables. The global dynamics for this entire solution exhibits the extinction of the inferior species by the superior one invading from both sides. The proof is carried out by applying the comparison principle for the competition-diffusion equations, that is, using an appropriate pair of a subsolution and a supersolution.}

Unlike the solitons in the Hamiltonian systems, their dissipative counterpart looks like an aggregation of bounded quasi-particles interacting on the short range, obeying the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution, and possessing a temperature, entropy, and other thermodynamic characteristics. This ensemble is confined by a collective potential, which defines its negative chemical potential. Such a dissipative soliton represents a strongly chirped pulse generated by a mode-locked laser with the advantage of being energy scalable by the analogy with the Bose-Einstein condensation from an incoherent ``basin.'' We demonstrate the main limits of the dissipative soliton energy scaling which result from the loss of internal soliton coherency and the thermalization due to nontriviality of a ``free energy landscape.''},

The traveling wave of the underlying system is very important in understanding the various applications it models.  Whereas the case of \$ g'(0) {$>$} 0\$ is the KPP type nonlinearity,  which is much studied and has very important results obtained in the literature not only in one-dimensional but also multidimensional settings,   the present case of non-KPP has more interesting features. Several significant issues  on traveling wave  still need to be addressed.   In particular,  for a traveling wave solution, one outstanding open  question is whether there exists a    minimum speed \$ c\_\{{\textbackslash}min\} {$>$} 0\$, which depends on \$ D\$, the function \$ g(v)\$, and the boundary condition at \$ - {\textbackslash}infty\$, such that a traveling wave solution of speed \$ c \$ exists iff  \$ c  {\textbackslash}geq c\_\{{\textbackslash}min\}\$. We settle this question by providing an affirmative answer. We also derive, with fixed function \$g\$,  sharp bounds  \$  c\_\{*\}(D) \$ and \$  c{\textasciicircum}\{*\}(D) {$>$} 0\$ such that a traveling wave solution with speed \$c\$  exists for any \$ c {\textbackslash}geq c{\textasciicircum}*\$, but no traveling wave with speed \$c\$ exists if \$ c {$<$} c\_\{*\}\$.

This model presents various fixed points. Analysis of this model has been made in the past only in the case when there is only a single fixed point, and a phase diagram of all the possible instabilities shows that there is a place where a Turing-Hopf bifurcation occurs producing oscillating Turing patterns. In here we focus on the interesting situation of having several fixed points, particularly when one unstable point is in between two equally stable points. We show that the solutions of this bistable system are traveling front waves, or solitons. The predictions and results are tested by performing extensive numerical calculations in one and two dimensions. The dynamics of these solitons is governed by a well defined spatial scale, and collisions and interactions between solitons depend on this scale. In certain regions of parameter space the wave fronts can be stationary, forming a pattern resembling spatial chaos. The patterns in two dimensions are particularly interesting because they can present a coherent dynamics with pseudo spiral rotations that simulate the myocardial beat quite closely. We show that our simple model can produce complicated spatial patterns with many different properties, and could be used in applications in many different fields.},

Using a Langevin equation, we find the exact Fourier transform of the distribution of these fluctuations for all {$\tau$}. By a saddle-point method we obtain analytical results for the inverse Fourier transform, which, for not too small {$\tau$}, agree very well with numerical results from a sampling method as well as from the fast Fourier transform algorithm. Due to the interaction of the deterministic part of the motion of the particle in the mechanical potential with the stochastic part of the motion caused by the fluid, the conventional heat fluctuation theorem is, for infinite and for finite {$\tau$}, replaced by an extended fluctuation theorem that differs noticeably and measurably from it. In particular, for large fluctuations, the ratio of the probability for absorption of heat (by the particle from the fluid) to the probability to supply heat (by the particle to the fluid) is much larger here than in the conventional fluctuation theorem.},

The expression of the uncertainty of vorticity, velocity divergence, mean value and Reynolds stresses is derived. It is shown that the uncertainty of vorticity and velocity divergence requires the knowledge of the spatial correlation between the error of the x and y particle image displacement, which depends upon the measurement spatial resolution. The uncertainty of statistical quantities is often dominated by the random uncertainty due to the finite sample size and decreases with the square root of the effective number of independent samples. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to assess the accuracy of the uncertainty propagation formulae. Furthermore, three experimental assessments are carried out. In the first experiment, a turntable is used to simulate a rigid rotation flow field. The estimated uncertainty of the vorticity is compared with the actual vorticity error root-mean-square, with differences between the two quantities within 5--10\% for different interrogation window sizes and overlap factors. A turbulent jet flow is investigated in the second experimental assessment. The reference velocity, which is used to compute the reference value of the instantaneous flow properties of interest, is obtained with an auxiliary PIV system, which features a higher dynamic range than the measurement system. Finally, the uncertainty quantification of statistical quantities is assessed via PIV measurements in a cavity flow. The comparison between estimated uncertainty and actual error demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed uncertainty propagation methodology.},

  abstract = {Uncertainties are typically assumed to be constant or a linear function of the measured value; however, this is generally not true. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is one example of a measurement technique that has highly nonlinear, time varying local uncertainties. Traditional uncertainty methods are not adequate for the estimation of the uncertainty of measurement statistics (mean and variance) in the presence of nonlinear, time varying errors. Propagation of instantaneous uncertainty estimates into measured statistics is performed allowing accurate uncertainty quantification of time-mean and statistics of measurements such as PIV. It is shown that random errors will always elevate the measured variance, and thus turbulent statistics such as . Within this paper, nonlinear, time varying errors are propagated from instantaneous measurements into the measured mean and variance using the Taylor-series method. With these results and knowledge of the systematic and random uncertainty of each measurement, the uncertainty of the time-mean, the variance and covariance can be found. Applicability of the Taylor-series uncertainty equations to time varying systematic and random errors and asymmetric error distributions are demonstrated with Monte-Carlo simulations. The Taylor-series uncertainty estimates are always accurate for uncertainties on the mean quantity. The Taylor-series variance uncertainty is similar to the Monte-Carlo results for cases in which asymmetric random errors exist or the magnitude of the instantaneous variations in the random and systematic errors is near the `true' variance. However, the Taylor-series method overpredicts the uncertainty in the variance as the instantaneous variations of systematic errors are large or are on the same order of magnitude as the `true' variance.},

  abstract = {Because populations are at the mercy of random disturbances large and small, they rarely, if ever, converge on predicted long-term behaviors. Therefore, when employing matrix population models, ecologists study the dynamics of populations that depart from stable distributions. Necessary for such studies are indices of transient dynamics that measure the size of short-term population fluctuations. These indices advance our understanding of population dynamics by revealing that population growth rate in a single timestep can far exceed the stable population growth rate. Despite their value, indices of transient behavior possess two major shortcomings: they are scale dependent and easily distorted by outsized population classes. Distortion occurs whenever immature classes, due to their sheer size, carry greater weight in the calculation of population size than mature classes. Beluga sturgeon (Huso huso), for example, have an immature age class (eggs) that is several orders of magnitude larger than its mature age classes. To remove the undue influence of outsized classes, I use balancing, which rescales classes by the stable population distribution and makes the indices of transient dynamics scale invariant. I apply balancing to 1800 population projection matrices for various species across the Animal Kingdom, using reactivity and the Henrici metric of non-normality as indices of transient dynamics. I found that balancing profoundly changes the picture of which populations have the greatest or least potential transient dynamics. Using a population projection matrix for northern pike (Esox lucius), I demonstrate how balancing influences pseudospectra contour plots that are used to infer transient dynamics.},

Recent technological developments have provided the tools to design and build scientific instruments of high enough sensitivity and precision to manipulate and visualize individual molecules and measure microscopic forces. Using SMEs it is possible to manipulate molecules one at a time and measure distributions describing molecular properties, characterize the kinetics of biomolecular reactions and detect molecular intermediates. SMEs provide additional information about thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecular processes. This complements information obtained in traditional bulk assays. In SMEs it is also possible to measure small energies and detect large Brownian deviations in biomolecular reactions, thereby offering new methods and systems to scrutinize the basic foundations of statistical mechanics. This review is written at a very introductory level, emphasizing the importance of SMEs to scientists interested in knowing the common playground of ideas and the interdisciplinary topics accessible by these techniques. The review discusses SMEs from an experimental perspective, first exposing the most common experimental methodologies and later presenting various molecular systems where such techniques have been applied. I briefly discuss experimental techniques such as atomic-force microscopy (AFM), laser optical tweezers (LOTs), magnetic tweezers (MTs), biomembrane force probes (BFPs) and single-molecule fluorescence (SMF). I then present several applications of SME to the study of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA and DNA condensation) and proteins (protein--protein interactions, protein folding and molecular motors). Finally, I discuss applications of SMEs to the study of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of small systems and the experimental verification of fluctuation theorems.

In addition to the theoretical basis for mathematical modeling, it covers a variety of tried-and-true identification algorithms and their applications. Moreover, its broad view and fairly modest mathematical level offer readers a quick appraisal of established methods and their limitations. In addition to surveys covering classical methods of identification --- including impulse, step, and sine-wave testing --- and identification based on correlation function, the text examines least-squares model fitting, statistical properties of estimators, optimal estimation, and Bayes and maximum-likelihood estimators. Other topics include experiment design and choice of model structure as well as model validation. Numerical examples show students how to apply the modeling theories, and a chapter on specialized topics introduces research areas.},

  abstract = {The possibility of downhill protein folding is one of the most intriguing predictions of the energy landscape approach. Finding examples of downhill folding has important practical implications because in the absence of a free energy barrier the mechanism of folding is amenable to experimental observation. Here, a simple statistical mechanical model of protein folding is used to analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of downhill and two-state folding. Folding free energy surfaces with and without a barrier separating denatured and native states can be generated with this model by simply modifying the curvature of the energy as a function of the order parameter, i.e., number of amino acids in incorrect conformation. Thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of surfaces with a barrier show the typical properties of two-state folding: a first-order equilibrium unfolding transition and exponential biphasic folding kinetics. In contrast, in downhill surfaces the unfolding process is noncooperative, and the apparent transition depends on the structural probe used to measure it. Therefore, this inherent behavior can be used as an experimental criterion for the identification of downhill folding. Surprisingly, the kinetics of downhill folding do not greatly deviate from exponential behavior unless the effective diffusion coefficient is assumed to decrese as folding progresses, exemplifying the increase in the roughness of the landscape. {\copyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Time reversal invariance (TRI) of particles systems has many consequences, among which the celebrated Onsager reciprocal relations, a milestone in Statistical Mechanics dating back to 1931. Because for a long time it was believed that (TRI) dos not hold in presence of a magnetic field, a modification of such relations was proposed by Casimir in 1945. Only in the last decade, the strict traditional notion of reversibility that led to Casimir's work has been questioned. It was then found that other symmetries can be used, which allow the Onsager reciprocal relations to hold without modification. In this paper we advance this investigation for classical Hamiltonian systems, substantially increasing the number of symmetries that yield TRI in presence of a magnetic field. We first deduce the most general form of a generalized time reversal operation on the phase space of such a system; secondly, we express sufficient conditions on the magnetic field which ensure TRI. Finally, we examine common examples from statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics. Our main result is that TRI holds in a much wider generality than previously believed, partially explaining why no experimental violation of Onsager relations has so far been reported.},

There is a great potential in harnessing the striking phenomenology of active matter to build novel controllable and responsive materials that surpass passive ones. Yet, we currently lack a systematic roadmap to predict the protocols driving active systems between different states in a way that is thermodynamically optimal. Equilibrium thermodynamics is an inadequate foundation to this end, due to the dissipation rate arising from the constant fuel consumption in active matter. Here, we derive and implement a versatile framework for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Combining recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics and response theory, our approach shows how to find the optimal control for either continuous- or discrete-state active systems operating out of equilibrium. Our results open the door to designing novel active materials that are not only built to stabilize specific nonequilibrium collective states but are also optimized to switch between different states at minimum dissipation.},

Even if the model generating the data and labels is known, computing the intrinsic uncertainty after learning the model from a limited number of samples amounts to sampling the corresponding posterior probability measure. Such sampling is computationally challenging in high-dimensional problems and theoretical results on heuristic uncertainty estimators in high-dimensions are thus scarce. In this manuscript, we characterize uncertainty for learning from a limited number of samples of high-dimensional Gaussian input data and labels generated by the probit model. In this setting, the Bayesian uncertainty (i.e. the posterior marginals) can be asymptotically obtained by the approximate message passing algorithm, bypassing the canonical but costly Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior. We then provide a closed-form formula for the joint statistics between the logistic classifier, the uncertainty of the statistically optimal Bayesian classifier and the ground-truth probit uncertainty. The formula allows us to investigate the calibration of the logistic classifier learning from a limited amount of samples. We discuss how over-confidence can be mitigated by appropriately regularizing.},

The Kauzmann temperature is the temperature at which the excess entropy vanishes. This review provides a retrospective on the origin of these hypotheses and their study through energy landscapes, crystallization behavior, and viscosity models. We also provide a critical analysis of each approach. After nearly eighty years of research, there is no conclusive evidence that supports the concepts proposed by Kauzmann.

Motivated by recent computational progress, we offer a pedagogical perspective on the configurational entropy in glass-forming liquids. We first explain why the configurational entropy has become a key quantity to describe glassy materials, from early empirical observations to modern theoretical treatments. We explain why practical measurements necessarily require approximations that make its physical interpretation delicate. We then demonstrate that computer simulations have become an invaluable tool to obtain precise, nonambiguous, and experimentally relevant measurements of the configurational entropy. We describe a panel of available computational tools, offering for each method a critical discussion. This perspective should be useful to both experimentalists and theoreticians interested in glassy materials and complex systems.},

Relaxation is assumed to be mediated by pathways that connect groups of local minima. The dynamics between these groups is treated via transition state theory using appropriate densities of states consistent with the thermodynamics of the model, with a general expression for the free energy barrier. Nonergodicity is admitted by successive disconnection of regions that no longer contribute to the partition function as a function of the observation time scale. The model exhibits properties typical of supercooled liquids and glasses spanning the whole range of ``fragile'' and ``strong'' behavior. Non-Arrhenius dynamics, characteristic of ``fragile'' glass formers, are observed when the barriers to relaxation increase as the potential energy decreases, but only if the observation time scale is long enough. For a fixed observation time, fragility generally increases as the free energy barriers decrease and vibrational frequencies increase. We associate higher vibrational frequencies with systems that have more local minima, and hence when the model exhibits dynamic fragility we usually see a large change in the heat capacity at the glass transition. However, in some regions of parameter space the expected correlations between dynamics and thermodynamics are not present.},

In complex chemical reaction networks, for example, such as those describing processes in internal combustion engines and power generators, rate constant estimates vary significantly across studies despite substantial experimental efforts. Here, we examine the possibility that variability in measured constants can be largely attributed to the impact of missing network information on parameter estimation. Through the numerical simulation of measurements in incomplete chemical reaction networks, we show that unaccountability of network links presumed unimportant (with local sensitivity amounting to less than two percent of that of a measured link) can create apparent rate constant variations as large as one order of magnitude even if no experimental errors are present in the data. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between the logarithmic deviation of the rate constant estimate and the cumulative relative sensitivity of the neglected reactions was less than 0.5 in all cases. Thus, for dynamical processes on complex networks, iteratively expanding a model by determining new parameters from data collected under specific conditions is unlikely to produce reliable results.},

The generalized Fokker-Planck equation with a nonstationary diffusion has been derived and used for chaos analysis. An anomalous transport turned out to be natural property of this equation. A nonlinear dispersion of the considered motion allowed us to find a principal consequence: a chaotic system with uniform dynamic properties tends to instable clustering. Small fluctuations of particles density increase by time and form attractors and stochastic islands even if the initial transport properties have uniform distribution. It was shown that an instability of phase trajectories leads to the nonlinear dispersion law and consequently to a space instability. A fixed boundary system was considered, using a standard Fokker-Planck equation. We have derived that such a type of dynamic systems has a discrete diffusive and energy spectra. It was shown that phase space diffusion is the only parameter that defines a dynamic accuracy in this case. The uncertainty relations have been obtained for conjugate phase space variables with account of transport properties. Given results can be used in the area of chaotic systems modelling and turbulence investigation.},

First-principles derivations of the underlying transitions can be characterized using bifurcation theory on model systems whose governing equations are known. In contrast, data-driven methods for more complicated and realistic systems whose governing evolution dynamics are unknown have only recently been developed. Here, we develop a data-driven approach, the sparse identification for nonlinear dynamics with control parameters (SINDyCP), to discover dynamics for systems with adjustable control parameters, such as an external driving strength. We demonstrate the method on systems of varying complexity, ranging from discrete maps to systems of partial differential equations. To mitigate the impact of measurement noise, we also develop a weak formulation of SINDyCP and assess its performance on noisy data. We demonstrate applications including the discovery of universal pattern-formation equations, and their bifurcation dependencies, directly from data accessible from experiments and the extrapolation of predictions beyond the weakly nonlinear regime near the onset of an instability.},

In this study, a physics-informed dynamic mode decomposition (piDMD) method, where the mass conservation law is integrated with a purely data-driven DMD method, is developed for fast prediction of the spatiotemporal dynamics of solid volume fraction distribution in bubbling fluidized beds. Assessment of the prediction ability using both piDMD and DMD is performed using the CFD-DEM results as the benchmark: Both DMD and piDMD can predict the short-term behaviour of solid volume fraction reasonably well, but piDMD outperforms the DMD in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons; With respect to their long-term ability, the piDMD-based prediction of the instantaneous solid volume fraction distributions is qualitatively correct although the accuracy needs to be improved, and the predicted time-averaged radial and axial profiles are satisfactory; Whereas the DMD-based prediction of instantaneous snapshots and time-averaged results is completely nonphysical. Present study provides a fast and relatively accurate method for predicting the hydrodynamics of gas-solid flows.},

DMD is a widely used data analysis technique that extracts low-rank modal structures and dynamics from high-dimensional measurements. However, DMD can produce models that are sensitive to noise, fail to generalize outside the training data and violate basic physical laws. Our physics-informed DMD (piDMD) optimization, which may be formulated as a Procrustes problem, restricts the family of admissible models to a matrix manifold that respects the physical structure of the system. We focus on five fundamental physical principles---conservation, self-adjointness, localization, causality and shift-equivariance---and derive several closed-form solutions and efficient algorithms for the corresponding piDMD optimizations. With fewer degrees of freedom, piDMD models are less prone to overfitting, require less training data, and are often less computationally expensive to build than standard DMD models. We demonstrate piDMD on a range of problems, including energy-preserving fluid flow, the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, solute advection-diffusion and three-dimensional transitional channel flow. In each case, piDMD outperforms standard DMD algorithms in metrics such as spectral identification, state prediction and estimation of optimal forcings and responses.},

When particles are identical their wave function must be either symmetric or antisymmetric under permutations and the number of microscopic states, which determines entropy, is counted up to permutations. When the particles are distinguishable, wavefunctions have no symmetry and each permutation is a different microstate. This binary and discontinuous classification raises a few questions: one may wonder what happens if particles are almost identical, or when the property that distinguishes between them is irrelevant to the physical interactions in a given system. Here I sketch a general answer to these questions. For any pair of non-identical particles there is a timescale, \$\${\textbackslash}tau \_d\$\$, required for a measurement to resolve the differences between them. Below \$\${\textbackslash}tau \_d\$\$, particles seem identical, above it - different, and the uncertainty principle provides a lower bound for \$\${\textbackslash}tau \_d\$\$. Thermal systems admit a conjugate temperature scale, \$\$T\_d\$\$. Above this temperature the system appears to equilibrate before it resolves the differences between particles, below this temperature the system identifies these differences before equilibration. As the physical differences between particles decline towards zero, \$\${\textbackslash}tau \_d {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\$\$and \$\$T\_d {\textbackslash}rightarrow 0\$\$.},

In this paper we critically analyze this method and its properties, and show how it can be viewed as a type of 2nd-order optimization method, with the Fisher information matrix acting as a substitute for the Hessian. In many important cases, the Fisher information matrix is shown to be equivalent to the Generalized Gauss-Newton matrix, which both approximates the Hessian, but also has certain properties that favor its use over the Hessian. This perspective turns out to have significant implications for the design of a practical and robust natural gradient optimizer, as it motivates the use of techniques like trust regions and Tikhonov regularization. Additionally, we make a series of contributions to the understanding of natural gradient and 2nd-order methods, including: a thorough analysis of the convergence speed of stochastic natural gradient descent (and more general stochastic 2nd-order methods) as applied to convex quadratics, a critical examination of the oft-used "empirical" approximation of the Fisher matrix, and an analysis of the (approximate) parameterization invariance property possessed by natural gradient methods (which we show also holds for certain other curvature, but notably not the Hessian).},

We propose a method to quantify this leakage using the Fisher information of the model about the data. Unlike the worst-case a priori guarantees of differential privacy, Fisher information loss measures leakage with respect to specific examples, attributes, or sub-populations within the dataset. We motivate Fisher information loss through the Cram{\textbackslash}'\{e\}r-Rao bound and delineate the implied threat model. We provide efficient methods to compute Fisher information loss for output-perturbed generalized linear models.

Thermodynamics of information analyzes this bidirectional influence between thermodynamics and information processing. The seminal ideas that Landauer and Bennett devised in the 1970s have been recently reformulated in a more precise and general way by realizing that informational states are out of equilibrium and applying new tools from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades ratchet mechanisms have transformed the understanding and design of stochastic molecular systems---biological, chemical and physical---in a move away from the mechanical macroscopic analogies that dominated thinking regarding molecular dynamics in the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g. pistons, springs, etc), to the more scale-relevant concepts that underpin out-of-equilibrium research in the molecular sciences today. Ratcheting has established molecular nanotechnology as a research frontier for energy transduction and metabolism, and has enabled the reverse engineering of biomolecular machinery, delivering insights into how molecules `walk' and track-based synthesisers operate, how the acceleration of chemical reactions enables energy to be transduced by catalysts (both motor proteins and synthetic catalysts), and how dynamic systems can be driven away from equilibrium through catalysis. The recognition of molecular ratchet mechanisms in biology, and their invention in synthetic systems, is proving significant in areas as diverse as supramolecular chemistry, systems chemistry, dynamic covalent chemistry, DNA nanotechnology, polymer and materials science, molecular biology, heterogeneous catalysis, endergonic synthesis, the origin of life, and many other branches of chemical science. Put simply, ratchet mechanisms give chemistry direction. Kinetic asymmetry, the key feature of ratcheting, is the dynamic counterpart of structural asymmetry (i.e. chirality). Given the ubiquity of ratchet mechanisms in endergonic chemical processes in biology, and their significance for behaviour and function from systems to synthesis, it is surely just as fundamentally important. This Review charts the recognition, invention and development of molecular ratchets, focussing particularly on the role for which they were originally envisaged in chemistry, as design elements for molecular machinery. Different kinetically asymmetric systems are compared, and the consequences of their dynamic behaviour discussed. These archetypal examples demonstrate how chemical systems can be driven inexorably away from equilibrium, rather than relax towards it.},

In situations where a system is time varying, one would like to update the system's description online as time evolves. This work provides an efficient method for computing DMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system's dynamics as new data becomes available.  The algorithm does not require storage of past data and computes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates.  A weighting factor that places less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward manner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems.  A variant of the method may also be applied to online computation of ``windowed DMD,'' in which only the most recent data are used.  The efficiency of the method is compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the state dimension is less than about 200, the proposed algorithm is the most efficient for real-time computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on several examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex example using data from a wind tunnel experiment.  In particular, we show that the method is effective at capturing the dynamics of surface pressure measurements in the flow over a flat plate with an unsteady separation bubble.},

All the methods presented are illustrated with examples involving real measurement results from a wide range of fields of chemistry and related sciences, ranging from classical analytical chemistry as practiced at the beginning to the 20th century, to contemporary studies of isotopic compositions of the elements and clinical trials. The supplementary material offers profusely annotated computer codes that allow the readers to reproduce all the calculations underlying the results presented in the examples.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the adaptability observed in biological materials, self-assembly processes have attracted significant interest for their potential to yield novel materials with unique properties. However, experimental methods have often fallen short in capturing the molecular details of the assembly process. In this study, we employ a multiscale molecular dynamics simulation approach, complemented by NMR quantification, to investigate the mechanism of self-assembly in a redox-fueled bioinspired system. Contrary to conventional assumptions, we have uncovered a significant role played by the monomer precursor in the assembly process, with its presence varying with concentration and the extent of conversion of the monomer to the dimer. Experimental confirmation through NMR quantification underscores the concentration-dependent incorporation of monomers into the fibrous structures. Furthermore, our simulations also shed light on the diverse intermolecular interactions, including T-shaped and parallel {$\pi$} stacking, as well as hydrogen bonds, in stabilizing the aggregates. Overall, the open conformation of the dimer is preferred within these aggregates. However, inside the aggregates, the distribution of conformations shifts slightly to the closed conformation compared to on the surface. These findings contribute to the growing field of bioinspired materials science by providing valuable mechanistic and structural insights to guide the design and development of self-assembling materials with biomimetic functionalities.},

However, it remains a major challenge to achieve precise control over dissipative supramolecular assembly structures and functions of self-contained systems. Here we combine light and electricity as two clean, and spatiotemporally addressable fuels to provide precise control over the morphology for dissipative self-assembly of a perylene bisimide glycine (PBIg) building block in a self-contained solution. In this design, electrochemical oxidation provides the positive fuel to activate PBIg self-assembly while photoreduction supplies the negative fuel to deactivate the system for disassembly. Through programming the two counteracting fuels, we demonstrated the control of PBIg self-assembly into a variety of assembly morphologies in a self-contained system. In addition, by exerting light and electrical dual fuels simultaneously, we could create an active homeostasis exhibiting dynamic instability, leading to morphological change to asymmetric assemblies with curvatures. Such precise control over self-assembly of self-contained systems may find future applications in programming complex active materials as well as formulating pharmaceutical reagents with desired morphologies.},

Biological systems use chemically derived energy to power out-of-equilibrium processes to generate complex macroscopic motion by dissipating energy at the molecular scale. In contrast, it remains a major challenge to create synthetic out-of-equilibrium systems that operate on the macroscopic scale. Herein we report a chemically fueled out-of-equilibrium system that can perform macroscopic actuation and do work by lifting objects. We achieve this by driving a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAm) hydrogels with heat generated by a copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAc) reaction. Upon completion of the reaction, heat dissipates to the environment, and the system returns to equilibrium, completing one cycle of out-of-equilibrium behavior, which can be repeated for multiple cycles by adding new chemical fuels.},

John McPhee shares insights he has gathered over his long career, and has refined while teaching at Princeton University, where he has nurtured some of the most highly regarded writers of our time. He discusses structure, diction and tone, observing that `readers are not supposed to notice the structure. It is meant to be about as visible as someone's bones'. This book is a vivid depiction of the writing process, from reporting to drafting to revising---and revising and revising. Draft No. 4 is enriched by personal reflections on the life of a writer. McPhee recalls his early years at Time magazine, and describes his enduring relationships with the New Yorker and with his publisher, Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Everything in this luminous book is enlivened by his keen sense of writing as a way of being in the world.  John McPhee is a staff writer at The New Yorker. He is the author of thirty-two books. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey and is a recipient of the Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award.  `Draft No. 4 belongs on the short shelf of essential books about the craft.' Wall Street Journal  `Matchless teaching from a master of the form---seductive, trustworthy and endearingly modest.' Helen Garner  `A master class in writing ... Almost every sentence sparkles ... A superb book.' Kirkus Reviews (starred review)  `Eight crisply instructive and drolly self-deprecating essays [are] gathered here in this exceptionally entertaining and illuminating book ... [Draft No. 4] is expert, charming, and invigorating.' Donna Seaman, Booklist  `McPhee has set the standard for the genre of creative nonfiction ... With humor and aplomb, he recalls anecdotes about how he approached a story: from interviewing and reporting to drafting and revising, to working with editors and publishers ... A well-wrought road map to navigating the twists and turns, thrills and pitfalls, and joys and sorrows of the writer's journey.' Donna Marie Smith, Library Journal  `[Draft No. 4 is] not a general how-to-do-it manual but a personal how-I-did-it of richer depth---not bouillon cubes, but rich stock ... McPhee lays it all out with the wit of one who believes that `writing has to be fun at least once in a pale blue moon.' Publishers Weekly  `A marvellous new book...A fascinating book for anyone interested in writing.' Australian  `Anyone aspiring to make a living from writing long-form journalism or literary non-fiction should read this book, absorb its lessons on the art of crafting clear and compelling prose, and then accept that the professional world McPhee was lucky enough to inhabit is now gone.'

Traditional statistical inference can then be based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts related to making formal inferences from more than one model (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book, but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new references to the technical literature are given. These changes result primarily from our experiences while giving several seminars, workshops, and graduate courses on material in the ?rst e- tion.},

  abstract = {Extant life contains numerous non-equilibrium mechanisms to create order not achievable at equilibrium; it is generally assumed that these mechanisms evolved because the resulting order was sufficiently beneficial to overcome associated costs of time and energy. Here, we identify a broad range of conditions under which non-equilibrium order-creating mechanisms will evolve as an inevitable consequence of self-replication, even if the order is not directly functional. We show that models of polymerases, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve kinetic proofreading through selection for fast replication alone, consistent with data from recent mutational screens. Similarly, replication contingent on fast self-assembly can select for non-equilibrium instabilities and result in more ordered structures without any direct selection for order. We abstract these results into a framework that predicts that self-replication intrinsically amplifies dissipative order-enhancing mechanisms if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can arise more easily than assumed, even before that order is directly functional, with consequences impacting mutation rate evolution and kinetic traps in self-assembly to the origin of life.},

This can be viewed as a hardware limitation (imposed by digital computers). Here we show that natural gradient descent (NGD), a second-order method, can have a similar computational complexity per iteration to a first-order method, when employing appropriate hardware. We present a new hybrid digital-analog algorithm for training neural networks that is equivalent to NGD in a certain parameter regime but avoids prohibitively costly linear system solves. Our algorithm exploits the thermodynamic properties of an analog system at equilibrium, and hence requires an analog thermodynamic computer. The training occurs in a hybrid digital-analog loop, where the gradient and Fisher information matrix (or any other positive semi-definite curvature matrix) are calculated at given time intervals while the analog dynamics take place. We numerically demonstrate the superiority of this approach over state-of-the-art digital first- and second-order training methods on classification tasks and language model fine-tuning tasks.},

  abstract = {Statistical divergences are important tools in data analysis, information theory, and statistical physics, and there exist well-known inequalities on their bounds. However, in many circumstances involving temporal evolution, one needs limitations on the rates of such quantities instead. Here, several general upper bounds on the rates of some f-divergences are derived, valid for any type of stochastic dynamics (both Markovian and non-Markovian), in terms of information-like and/or thermodynamic observables. As special cases, the analytical bounds on the rate of mutual information are obtained. The major role in all those limitations is played by temporal Fisher information, characterizing the speed of global system dynamics, and some of them contain entropy production, suggesting a link with stochastic thermodynamics. Indeed, the derived inequalities can be used for estimation of minimal dissipation and global speed in thermodynamic stochastic systems. Specific applications of these inequalities in physics and neuroscience are given, which include the bounds on the rates of free energy and work in nonequilibrium systems, limits on the speed of information gain in learning synapses, as well as the bounds on the speed of predictive inference and learning rate. Overall, the derived bounds can be applied to any complex network of interacting elements, where predictability and thermodynamics of network dynamics are of prime concern.},

Their dynamics is described by deterministic rate equations with mass action kinetics. Our most general framework considers open networks driven by time-dependent chemostats. The energy and entropy balances are established and a nonequilibrium Gibbs free energy is introduced. The difference between this latter and its equilibrium form represents the minimal work done by the chemostats to bring the network to its nonequilibrium state. It is minimized in nondriven detailed-balanced networks (i.e., networks that relax to equilibrium states) and has an interesting information-theoretic interpretation. We further show that the entropy production of complex-balanced networks (i.e., networks that relax to special kinds of nonequilibrium steady states) splits into two non-negative contributions: one characterizing the dissipation of the nonequilibrium steady state and the other the transients due to relaxation and driving. Our theory lays the path to study time-dependent energy and information transduction in biochemical networks.},

We first introduce closed networks ``in a box'', whose thermodynamics is subjected to strict physical constraints: the mass-action law, elementarity of processes, and detailed balance. We further digress on the role of solvents and on the seemingly unacknowledged property of network independence of free energy landscapes. We then open the system by assuming that the concentrations of certain substrate species (the chemostats) are fixed, whether because promptly regulated by the environment via contact with reservoirs, or because nearly constant in a time window. As a result, the system is driven out of equilibrium. A rich algebraic and topological structure ensues in the network of internal species: Emergent irreversible cycles are associated with nonvanishing affinities, whose symmetries are dictated by the breakage of conservation laws. These central results are resumed in the relation a + b = sY between the number of fundamental affinities a, that of broken conservation laws b and the number of chemostats sY. We decompose the steady state entropy production rate in terms of fundamental fluxes and affinities in the spirit of Schnakenberg's theory of network thermodynamics, paving the way for the forthcoming treatment of the linear regime, of efficiency and tight coupling, of free energy transduction, and of thermodynamic constraints for network reconstruction.},

It was proposed that biological building blocks evolved from the inorganic substances present in the early earth conditions. However, the process by which chemistry can be converted into biology has not yet been achieved in the laboratory. The artificial system in the out-of-equilibrium state must maintain a few critical features of life, like compartmentalization, metabolism, and replication, to be considered alive. In this direction, working with cysteine (Cys)-based molecules is strategic to understand the life evolution process. The presence of the sulphydryl (-SH) group in the Cys-residue can build a dynamic equilibrium state through disulfide redox chemistry under the proper guidance of oxidizing and reducing agents. In this review article, our primary focus is to discuss the Cys-containing short-peptide-based self-assembly and disassembly processes. The formation of disulfide bonds sometimes helps in the self-assembly process and gelation, but the reverse is also true in some cases. In the later part of this article, we cover the fact that these sulphydryl-based systems have shown their adaptability to mimic different life-essential criteria to participate in Darwinian evolution.},

As a key feature, the model includes both the spatial and temporal aspects and a free energy functional between dense and dilute phase that is physically motivated by reference molecular simulation. The exhaustive numerical simulations of model captures the dynamical formation of droplets and existence of LLPS. As the time progresses, simulation reveal that smaller droplets gradually vanish, and a single droplet undergoes continuous growth until it reaches a stable size. The model predicts that that extent of diffusivity of dense and dilute phase as well as their mutual interaction would modulate the kinetics of droplet formation. Finally we show that introduction of fluctuation in the model accelerate the phase separation process.},

This may arise from active contributions to particle fluctuations which are unrelated to the dissipative resistance of the surrounding medium. We show that in these cases the widely used relation between informatic entropy production and heat dissipation does not hold. Consequently, fluctuation relations for the mechanical work, such as the Jarzynski and Crooks theorems, are invalid. We relate the breaking of the correspondence between entropy production and heat dissipation to the breaking of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We propose a temperature-like variable which restores this correspondence and gives rise to a generalized second law of thermodynamics, whereby the dissipated heat is necessarily nonnegative and vanishes at equilibrium. The Clausius inequality, Carnot maximum efficiency theorem, and relation between the maximum extractable work and the change of free energy are recovered as well.},

Here, we report a new platform to program hydrogel films with tunable, time-dependent mechanical properties under out-of-equilibrium conditions, powered by electricity. We show that the lifetime of the transient network of a surface-confined hydrogel film can be effectively controlled by programming the generation of an electrochemically oxidized mediator in the presence of a chemical or photoreducing agent in solution. It is, therefore, electrically possible to direct the transient stiffening or softening of the hydrogel film, enabling high modularity of the material functions with precise spatiotemporal control. Temporally controlled operations of the hydrogel films are demonstrated for the on-demand, dose-controlled release of multiple model protein payloads from electrode arrays using the present electrically powered dissipative system. This demonstration of electrically driven transient modulation of the stiffness properties of hydrogel films represents an important step toward the engineering of dissipative materials for developing future biomedical applications that can harness the temporal, adaptive properties of this new class of materials.},

The corresponding integrated stationary state fluctuation theorem (ISSFT) was not observed. Using an overdamped Langevin equation and an arbitrary motion for the center of the harmonic force, all quantities of interest for these theorems and the corresponding nonintegrated ones (TFT and SSFT, respectively) are theoretically explicitly obtained in this paper. While the TFT and the ITFT are satisfied for all times, the SSFT and the ISSFT only hold asymptotically in time. Suggestions for further experiments with arbitrary velocity of the harmonic force and in which also the ISSFT could be observed, are given. In addition, a nontrivial long-time relation between the ITFT and the ISSFT was discovered, which could be observed experimentally, especially in the case of a resonant circular motion of the center of the harmonic force.},

This technique, primarily applied to inorganic materials, is now being used to explore the self-assembly dynamics of active molecular materials. Our study examines these dynamics across various scales, from the nanoscale behavior of individual fibers to the micrometer-scale hierarchical evolution of fiber clusters. To isolate the influences of the electron beam and electrical potential on material behavior, we conducted thorough beam--sample interaction analyses. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of these active materials at the nanoscale are shaped by their proximity to the electrode and the applied electrical current. By integrating electron microscopy observations with reaction--diffusion simulations, we uncover that local structures and their formation history play a crucial role in determining assembly rates. This suggests that the emergence of nonequilibrium structures can locally accelerate further structural development, offering insights into the behavior of active materials under electrochemical conditions.},

The localization of the particles in the network, akin to some extent to caging in dense glasses, is determined by the network topology, and the network restructuring, which takes place via bond breaking and recombination, is characterized by highly cooperative dynamics. We use NVE and NVT molecular dynamics as well as Langevin dynamics and find a qualitatively similar time dependence of time correlations and of the dynamical susceptibility of the restructuring gel.

Here, we review a framework for computer-aided multiscale analysis, which enables macroscopic computational tasks (over extended spatiotemporal scales) using only appropriately initialized microscopic simulation on short time and length scales. The methodology bypasses the derivation of macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form---hence the term equation-free.

While the Einstein relation describes an inverse relationship valid for Newtonian solvents, both concepts are generalized to time-dependent memory kernels in viscoelastic fluids. We theoretically and experimentally investigate their relation by considering two observables: the recoil after releasing a probe that was moved through the fluid and the equilibrium mean squared displacement (MSD). Applying concepts of linear response theory, we generalize Einstein's relation and, thereby, relate recoil and MSD, which both provide access to the mobility kernel. With increasing concentration, however, MSD and recoil show distinct behaviors, rooted in different behaviors of the two kernels. Using two theoretical models, a linear two-bath particle model, and hard spheres treated by mode coupling theory, we find a Volterra relation between the two kernels, explaining differing timescales in friction and mobility kernels under variation of concentration.},

  abstract = {Nonequilibrium systems, in particular living organisms, are maintained by irreversible transformations of energy that drive diverse functions. Quantifying their irreversibility, as measured by energy dissipation, is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms. However, existing techniques usually overlook experimental limitations, either by assuming full information or by employing a coarse-graining method that requires knowledge of the structure behind hidden degrees of freedom. Here, we study the inference of dissipation from finite-resolution measurements by employing a recently developed model-free estimator that considers both the sequence of coarse-grained transitions and the waiting time distributions: \${\textbackslash}sigma\_2={\textbackslash}sigma\_2{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ell + {\textbackslash}sigma\_2{\textasciicircum}t\$. The dominant term \${\textbackslash}sigma\_2{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ell\$ originates from the sequence of observed transitions; we find that it scales with resolution following a power law. Comparing the scaling exponent with a previous estimator highlights the importance of accounting for flux correlations at lower resolutions. \${\textbackslash}sigma\_2{\textasciicircum}t\$ comes from asymmetries in waiting time distributions, with its peak revealing characteristic scales of the underlying dissipative process. Alternatively, the characteristic scale can be detected in a crossover of the scaling of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_2{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ell\$. This provides a novel perspective for extracting otherwise hidden characteristic dissipative scales directly from dissipation measurements. We illustrate these results in biochemical models as well as complex networks. Overall, this study highlights the significance of resolution considerations in nonequilibrium systems, providing insights into the interplay between experimental resolution, entropy production, and underlying complexity.},

They also manifest non-conservative forces, and the motions of the nano-particles are overdamped; i.e., they exhibit diffusive trajectories. We propose a data-driven approach based on principal components analysis (PCA) to determine the collective modes of non-conservative overdamped systems, such as OM structures, and harmonic linear discriminant analysis (HLDA) of time trajectories to estimate the reaction coordinate for structural transitions. We demonstrate the approach via electrodynamics-Langevin dynamics simulations of~six electrodynamically-bound nanoparticles in an incident laser beam. The reaction coordinate we discover is in excellent accord with a rigorous committor analysis, and the identified mechanism for structural isomerization~is in very~good agreement with the experimental observations. The PCA-HLDA approach to data-driven discovery of reaction coordinates can~aid in understanding and eventually controlling non-conservative and overdamped systems including optical and active matter systems.},

However, quantitative extraction of physical and chemical parameters from the liquid-phase TEM videos remains bottlenecked by the lack of automated analysis methods compatible with the videos' high noisiness and spatial heterogeneity. Here, we integrate, for the first time, liquid-phase TEM imaging with our customized analysis framework based on a machine learning model called U-Net neural network. This combination is made possible by our workflow to generate simulated TEM images as the training data with well-defined ground truth. We apply this framework to three typical systems of colloidal nanoparticles, concerning their diffusion and interaction, reaction kinetics, and assembly dynamics, all resolved in real-time and real-space by liquid-phase TEM. A diversity of properties for differently shaped anisotropic nanoparticles are mapped, including the anisotropic interaction landscape of nanoprisms, curvature-dependent and staged etching profiles of nanorods, and an unexpected kinetic law of first-order chaining assembly of concave nanocubes. These systems representing properties at the nanoscale are otherwise experimentally inaccessible. Compared to the prevalent image segmentation methods, U-Net shows a superior capability to predict the position and shape boundary of nanoparticles from highly noisy and fluctuating background---a challenge common and sometimes inevitable in liquid-phase TEM videos. We expect our framework to push the potency of liquid-phase TEM to its full quantitative level and to shed insights, in high-throughput and statistically significant fashion, on the nanoscale dynamics of synthetic and biological nanomaterials.},

Such integration has taken the form of statistical analysis of large data sets, or through the bottom--up reconstruction of reaction networks. While progress has been made with statistical and structural methods, large-scale systems have remained refractory to dynamic model building by traditional approaches. The availability of annotated genomes enabled the reconstruction of genome-scale networks, and now the availability of high-throughput metabolomic and fluxomic data along with thermodynamic information opens the possibility to build genome-scale kinetic models. We describe here a framework for building and analyzing such models. The mathematical analysis challenges are reflected in four foundational properties, (i) the decomposition of the Jacobian matrix into chemical, kinetic and thermodynamic information, (ii) the structural similarity between the stoichiometric matrix and the transpose of the gradient matrix, (iii) the duality transformations enabling either fluxes or concentrations to serve as the independent variables and (iv) the timescale hierarchy in biological networks. Recognition and appreciation of these properties highlight notable and challenging new in silico analysis issues.},

Yet even though neural network models see increasing use in the physical sciences, they struggle to learn these symmetries. In this paper, we propose Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), which can parameterize arbitrary Lagrangians using neural networks. In contrast to models that learn Hamiltonians, LNNs do not require canonical coordinates, and thus perform well in situations where canonical momenta are unknown or difficult to compute. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not restrict the functional form of learned energies and will produce energy-conserving models for a variety of tasks. We test our approach on a double pendulum and a relativistic particle, demonstrating energy conservation where a baseline approach incurs dissipation and modeling relativity without canonical coordinates where a Hamiltonian approach fails. Finally, we show how this model can be applied to graphs and continuous systems using a Lagrangian Graph Network, and demonstrate it on the 1D wave equation.},

  abstract = {The principle of least action is one of the most fundamental physical principle. It says that among all possible motions connecting two points in a phase space, the system will exhibit those motions which extremise an action functional. Many qualitative features of dynamical systems, such as the presence of conservation laws and energy balance equations, are related to the existence of an action functional. Incorporating variational structure into learning algorithms for dynamical systems is, therefore, crucial in order to make sure that the learned model shares important features with the exact physical system. In this paper we show how to incorporate variational principles into trajectory predictions of learned dynamical systems. The novelty of this work is that (1) our technique relies only on discrete position data of observed trajectories. Velocities or conjugate momenta do not need to be observed or approximated and no prior knowledge about the form of the variational principle is assumed. Instead, they are recovered using backward error analysis. (2) Moreover, our technique compensates discretisation errors when trajectories are computed from the learned system. This is important when moderate to large step-sizes are used and high accuracy is required. For this, we introduce and rigorously analyse the concept of inverse modified Lagrangians by developing an inverse version of variational backward error analysis. (3) Finally, we introduce a method to perform system identification from position observations only, based on variational backward error analysis.},

  abstract = {Dissipative self-assembly is the emergence of order within a system due to the continuous input of energy. This form of nonequilibrium self-organization allows the creation of structures that are inaccessible in equilibrium self-assembly. However, design strategies for dissipative self-assembly are limited by a lack of fundamental understanding of the process. This work proposes a novel route for dissipative self-assembly via the oscillation of interparticle potentials. It is demonstrated that in the limit of fast potential oscillations the structure of the system is exactly described by an effective potential that is the time average of the oscillatory potential. This effective potential depends on the shape of the oscillations and can lead to effective interactions that are physically inaccessible in equilibrium. As a proof of concept, Brownian dynamics simulations were performed on a binary mixture of particles coated by weak acids and weak bases under externally controlled oscillations of pH. Dissipative steady-state structures were formed when the period of the pH oscillations was smaller than the diffusional timescale of the particles, whereas disordered oscillating structures were observed for longer oscillation periods. Some of the dissipative structures (dimers, fibers, and honeycombs) cannot be obtained in equilibrium (fixed pH) simulations for the same system of particles. The transition from dissipative self-assembled structures for fast oscillations to disordered oscillating structures for slow oscillations is characterized by a maximum in the energy dissipated per oscillation cycle. The generality of the concept is demonstrated in a second system with oscillating particle sizes.},

In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori.

In particular, the spread, signs, and shapes of the coherence maps collectively characterize the state of the system and the nature of the dynamics, as well as the equilibrium state. The topology of the system is readily reflected in its coherence map. Rows and columns show the composition of quantum superpositions, and their filling indicates the extent of the surviving coherence. Linear combinations of imaginary RDM elements specify instantaneous population derivatives. The main diagonal comprises the incoherent component of the dynamics, while the upper/lower triangular areas give rise to coherent contributions that increase the purity of the RDM. In open systems, the coherence map evolves to a band surrounding the principal diagonal whose width decreases with increasing temperature and dissipation strength. We illustrate these behaviors with examples of 10-site model molecular aggregates with Frenkel exciton couplings, where the electronic states of each monomer are coupled to harmonic vibrational baths.}

Among the different statements of this fundamental property of the full quantum mechanical nature of physical reality, the uncertainty relation for energy and time has a special place. Its interpretation and its consequences have inspired continued research efforts for almost a century. In its modern formulation, the uncertainty relation is understood as setting a fundamental bound on how fast any quantum system can evolve. In this topical review we describe important milestones, such as the Mandelstam--Tamm and the Margolus--Levitin bounds on the quantum speed limit, and summarise recent applications in a variety of current research fields---including quantum information theory, quantum computing, and quantum thermodynamics amongst several others. To bring order and to provide an access point into the many different notions and concepts, we have grouped the various approaches into the minimal time approach and the geometric approach, where the former relies on quantum control theory, and the latter arises from measuring the distinguishability of quantum states. Due to the volume of the literature, this topical review can only present a snapshot of the current state-of-the-art and can never be fully comprehensive. Therefore, we highlight but a few works hoping that our selection can serve as a representative starting point for the interested reader.},

Postselection can improve the rate of Fisher information (the average information learned about an unknown parameter from a trial) to cost. We show that this improvement stems from the negativity of a particular quasiprobability distribution, a quantum extension of a probability distribution. In a classical theory, in which all observables commute, our quasiprobability distribution is real and nonnegative. In a quantum-mechanically noncommuting theory, nonclassicality manifests in negative or nonreal quasiprobabilities. Negative quasiprobabilities enable postselected experiments to outperform optimal postselection-free experiments: postselected quantum experiments can yield anomalously large information-cost rates. This advantage, we prove, is unrealizable in any classically commuting theory. Finally, we construct a preparation-and-postselection procedure that yields an arbitrarily large Fisher information. Our results establish the nonclassicality of a metrological advantage, leveraging our quasiprobability distribution as a mathematical tool.},

  abstract = {Quantum estimation theory is a reformulation of random statistical theory with the modern language of quantum mechanics. In fact, the density operator plays a role similar to that of probability distribution functions in classical probability theory and statistics. However, the use of the probability distribution functions in classical theories is founded on premises that seem intuitively clear enough. Whereas in quantum theory, the situation with operators is different due to its non-commutativity nature. By exploiting this difference, quantum estimation theory aims to attain ultra-measurement precision that would otherwise be impossible with classical resources. In this thesis, we reviewed all the fundamental principles of classical estimation theory. Next, we extend our analysis to quantum estimation theory. Due to the non-commutativity of quantum mechanics, we prove the different families of QFIs and the corresponding QCRBs. We compared these bounds and discussed their accessibility in the single-parameter and multiparameter estimation cases. We also introduce HCRB as the most informative alternative bound suitable for multiparameter estimation protocols. Since the quantum state of light is the most accessible in practice, we studied the quantum estimation theory with the formalism of these types of quantum states. We formulate, with complete generality, the quantum estimation theory for Gaussian states in terms of their first and second moments. Furthermore, we address the motivation behind using Gaussian quantum resources and their advantages in reaching the standard quantum limits under realistic noise. In this context, we propose and analyze a measurement scheme that aims to exploit quantum Gaussian entangled states to estimate the displacement parameters under a noisy Gaussian environment.},

In these systems, droplets grow by the addition of droplet material generated by chemical reactions. Surprisingly, we find that chemically driven droplet growth can lead to shape instabilities that trigger the division of droplets into two smaller daughters. Therefore, chemically active droplets can exhibit cycles of growth and division that resemble the proliferation of living cells. Dividing active droplets could serve as a model for prebiotic protocells, where chemical reactions in the droplet play the role of a prebiotic metabolism.},

In our model, centrosome material occurs in a soluble form and a form that tends to form droplets by phase separation. We find that an autocatalytic chemical transition between these forms quantitatively accounts for our experimental data. Importantly, a catalytic activity of the centrioles, which are located inside centrosomes, can control centrosome nucleation and suppress Ostwald ripening to allow for two equal-sized centrosomes to coexist in the cell. Consequently, our example shows how the combination of chemical reactions and phase separation can be used to control the formation of liquid-like compartments in cells., Centrosomes are highly dynamic, spherical organelles without a membrane. Their physical nature and their assembly are not understood. Using the concept of phase separation, we propose a theoretical description of centrosomes as liquid droplets. In our model, centrosome material occurs in a form soluble in the cytosol and a form that tends to undergo phase separation from the cytosol. We show that an autocatalytic chemical transition between these forms accounts for the temporal evolution observed in experiments. Interestingly, the nucleation of centrosomes can be controlled by an enzymatic activity of the centrioles, which are present at the core of all centrosomes. This nonequilibrium feature also allows for multiple stable centrosomes, a situation that is unstable in equilibrium phase separation. Our theory explains the growth dynamics of centrosomes for all cell sizes down to the eight-cell stage of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, and it also accounts for data acquired in experiments with aberrant numbers of centrosomes and altered cell volumes. Furthermore, the model can describe unequal centrosome sizes observed in cells with perturbed centrioles. We also propose an interpretation of the molecular details of the involved proteins in the case of C. elegans. Our example suggests a general picture of the organization of membraneless organelles.},

It is shown that association and formation of a reversible network is always accompanied by a tendency for phase separation which might occur even under marginal solvent conditions. The mean-field theory is also generalized to take into account the effect of local intrachain loops as well as excluded volume interactions (partial swelling of polymer chains).

  abstract = {The remarkable processes that characterize living organisms, such as motility, self-healing and reproduction, are fuelled by a continuous injection of energy at the microscale. The field of active matter focuses on understanding how the collective behaviours of internally driven components can give rise to these biological phenomena, while also striving to produce synthetic materials composed of active energy-consuming components. The synergistic approach of studying active matter in both living cells and reconstituted systems assembled from biochemical building blocks has the potential to transform our understanding of both cell biology and materials science. This methodology can provide insight into the fundamental principles that govern the dynamical behaviours of self-organizing subcellular structures, and can lead to the design of artificial materials and machines that operate away from equilibrium and can thus attain life-like properties. In this Review, we focus on active materials made of cytoskeletal components, highlighting the role of active stresses and how they drive self-organization of both cellular structures and macroscale materials, which are machines powered by nanomachines.},

  abstract = {Regulation of biological processes typically incorporate mechanisms that both initiate and terminate the process and, where understood, these mechanisms often involve feedback control. Regulation of transcription is a fundamental cellular process where the mechanisms involved in initiation have been studied extensively but those involved in arresting the process are poorly understood. Modeling of the potential roles of RNA in transcriptional control suggested a non-equilibrium feedback control mechanism wherein low levels of RNA promote condensates formed by electrostatic interactions whereas relatively high levels promote dissolution of these condensates. Evidence from both in vitro and in vivo experiments support the model that RNAs produced during early steps in transcription initiation stimulate condensate formation whereas the burst of RNAs produced during elongation stimulate condensate dissolution. We propose that transcriptional regulation incorporates a feedback mechanism whereby transcribed RNAs initially stimulate but then ultimately arrest the process., During the early steps of transcription initiation nascent RNAs stimulate transcriptional condensate formation whereas the burst of RNAs produced during elongation stimulate condensate dissolution.,},

Here, we show that both the size and shape of the amphibian oocyte nucleolus ultimately arise because nucleoli behave as liquid-like droplets of RNA and protein, exhibiting characteristic viscous fluid dynamics even on timescales of {$<~$}1~min. We use these dynamics to determine an apparent nucleolar viscosity, and we show that this viscosity is ATP-dependent, suggesting a role for active processes in fluidizing internal contents. Nucleolar surface tension and fluidity cause their restructuring into spherical droplets upon imposed mechanical deformations. Nucleoli exhibit a broad distribution of sizes with a characteristic power law, which we show is a consequence of spontaneous coalescence events. These results have implications for the function of nucleoli in ribosome subunit processing and provide a physical link between activity within a macromolecular assembly and its physical properties on larger length scales.},

A distinctive feature of our mathematical model is that it can represent both deformable self-propelled objects, such as droplets, and solid objects, such as camphor disks, by controlling a single parameter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, by taking the singular limit, this phase-field based model can be reduced to a free boundary model, which is equivalent to the \$\$L{\textasciicircum}2\$\$-gradient flow model of self-propelled objects derived by the variational principle from the interfacial energy, which gives a physical interpretation to the phase-field model.},

These droplets are controlled using physical processes like chemical reactions and imposed gradients, which are costly to simulate using traditional approaches, like solving the Cahn--Hilliard equation. To overcome this challenge, we here present an alternative, efficient method. The main idea is to focus on the relevant degrees of freedom, like droplet positions and sizes. We derive dynamical equations for these quantities using approximate analytical solutions obtained from a sharp interface limit and linearized equations in the bulk phases. We verify our method against fully-resolved simulations and show that it can describe interacting droplets under the influence of chemical reactions and external gradients using only a fraction of the computational costs of traditional methods. Our method can be extended to include other processes in the future and will thus serve as a relevant platform for understanding the dynamics of droplets in cells.},

These experiments marked the beginning of the ``fast-folding'' subfield that enabled investigation of the kinetics of formation of secondary structural elements and disordered loops for the first time, as well as the fastest folding proteins. When I started to work on this subject, a fast folding protein was one that folded in milliseconds. There were, moreover, no analytical theoretical models and no atomistic or coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to describe the mechanism. Two of the most important discoveries from my lab since then are a protein that folds in hundreds of nanoseconds, as determined from nanosecond laser temperature experiments, and the discovery that the theoretically predicted barrier crossing time is about the same for proteins that differ in folding rates by 104-fold, as determined from single molecule fluorescence measurements. We also developed what has been called the ``H{\"u}ckel model'' of protein folding, which quantitatively explains a wide range of equilibrium and kinetic measurements. This retrospective traces the history of contributions to the ``fast folding'' subfield from my lab until about 3 years ago, when I left protein folding to spend the rest of my research career trying to discover an inexpensive drug for treating sickle cell disease.},

The simulations were generated using a new distributed computing method, yielding hundreds of trajectories each on a time scale comparable to the experimental folding time, despite the large (10,000 atom) size of the simulation system. This strategy eliminates the need to assume a two-state kinetic model or to build a Markov state model. The relaxation to the folded state at 300 K from the unfolded configurations (generated by simulation at 373 K) was monitored by a method intended to reflect the experimental observable (quenching of tryptophan by histidine). We also monitored the relaxation to the native state by directly comparing structural snapshots with the native state. The rate of relaxation to the native state and the number of resolvable kinetic time scales both depend upon starting structure. Moreover, starting structures with folding rates most similar to experiment show some native-like structure in the N-terminal helix (helix 1) and the phenylalanine residues constituting the hydrophobic core, suggesting that these elements may exist in the experimentally relevant unfolded state. Our large-scale simulation data reveal kinetic complexity not resolved in the experimental data.

  abstract = {Liquid--liquid phase separation is key to understanding aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) arising throughout cell biology, medical science, and the pharmaceutical industry. Controlling the detailed morphology of phase-separating compound droplets leads to new technologies for efficient single-cell analysis, targeted drug delivery, and effective cell scaffolds for wound healing. We present a computational model of liquid--liquid phase separation relevant to recent laboratory experiments with gelatin--polyethylene glycol mixtures. We include buoyancy and surface-tension-driven finite viscosity fluid dynamics with thermally induced phase separation. We show that the fluid dynamics greatly alters the evolution and equilibria of the phase separation problem. Notably, buoyancy plays a critical role in driving the ATPS to energy-minimizing crescent-shaped morphologies, and shear flows can generate a tenfold speedup in particle formation. Neglecting fluid dynamics produces incorrect minimum-energy droplet shapes. The model allows for optimization of current manufacturing procedures for structured microparticles and improves understanding of ATPS evolution in confined and flowing settings important in biology and biotechnology.},

  abstract = {Amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) protein aggregates through a complex pathway to progress from monomers to soluble oligomers and ultimately insoluble fibrils. Because of the dynamic nature of aggregation, it has proven exceedingly difficult to determine the precise interactions that lead to the formation of transient oligomers. Here, a statistical thermodynamic model has been developed to elucidate these interactions. A{$\beta$}1--42 was simulated using fully atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics. We use an ensemble of approximately 5 {\texttimes} 105 configurations taken from simulation as input in a self-consistent field theory that explicitly accounts for the size, shape, and charge distribution of both the amino acids comprising A{$\beta$} and all molecular species present in solution. The solution of the model equations provides a prediction of the probabilities of the configurations of the A{$\beta$} dimer and the potential of mean force between two monomers during the dimerization process. This model constitutes a reliable methodology to elucidate the underlying physics of the A{$\beta$} dimerization process as a function of pH, temperature, and salt concentration. The results obtained with this new model could be valuable in the design of A{$\beta$} oligomerization inhibitors, a prospective therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.},

This study tracked multiple cohorts of transfer students matriculated at the four-year university between fall 2007 and fall 2014, and used data drawn from their transcript records. The findings indicated that STEM switchers, who obtained a non-STEM degree within six years of their initial transfer, were more likely to be older learners, female, and of non-Asian race/ethnicity than STEM persisters, who earned a STEM degree within six years. STEM Leavers, who did not earn any degree within six years, were more likely to be older, non-Asian, first-generation, and had a low or middle family income than STEM persisters. The study also found that STEM switchers and leavers were more likely to transfer over a lower number of courses, attempted fewer courses in the first semester, withdrew one or more courses, and received a lower semester GPA. In terms of mathematics preparation, STEM switchers and leavers were less likely to complete Calculus I or more advanced courses. The study contributes to the literature on STEM persistence and attrition, especially for STEM aspirants who transferred from community colleges to four-year universities. The findings also provide new knowledge about STEM attrition by comparing students who departed from STEM with or without earning a non-STEM degree.}

There are several institutional and academic factors that influence transfer outcomes. But one of the most central factors that can either help students successfully navigate the two-to-four-year pathway or cause significant roadblocks and cost students considerable delays -- is advising. In this study, we investigate how advising practices at three institutions -- two community colleges and one university -- contribute to the success of underrepresented students on the transfer pathway in STEM disciplines. We conducted interviews with 39 near-transfer or recently transferred students in STEM. Most students experienced at least some good advising (n~= 28); however, 21 students reported poor advising experiences, which in some cases created undue challenges and barriers. Positive advising experiences contributed to students' sense of trust with their advisors, departments, and the institution. Early positive relationships with advisors also contributed to students being more likely to seek future help from advisors (including at other institutions); conversely negative advising relationships contributed to students being more likely to seek help elsewhere, like from friends or family, and sometimes giving up and not receiving any help at all.}

Although experiments on pattern formation using chemical systems have shown that temperature differences play a role in pattern formation, there is far less theoretical work concerning the interplay between temperature and spatial instabilities. We consider a thermodynamically extended reaction--diffusion system, consisting of a pair of reaction--diffusion equations coupled to an energy equation for temperature, and use this to obtain a natural extension of the Turing instability accounting for temperature. We show that thermal contributions can restrict or enlarge the set of unstable modes possible under the instability, and in some cases may be used to completely shift the set of unstable modes, strongly modifying emergent Turing patterns. Spatial heterogeneity plays a role under several experimentally feasible configurations, and we give particular consideration to scenarios involving thermal gradients, thermodynamics of chemicals transported within a flow, and thermodiffusion. Control of Turing patterns is also an area of active interest, and we also demonstrate how patterns can be modified using time-dependent control of the boundary temperature.},

  abstract = {The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) is a recently proposed data-driven modelling framework that uses sparse regression techniques to identify nonlinear low-order models. With the goal of low-order models of a fluid flow, we combine this approach with dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g. proper orthogonal decomposition) and extend it to enforce physical constraints in the regression, e.g. energy-preserving quadratic nonlinearities. The resulting models, hereafter referred to as Galerkin regression models, incorporate many beneficial aspects of Galerkin projection, but without the need for a high-fidelity solver to project the Navier--Stokes equations. Instead, the most parsimonious nonlinear model is determined that is consistent with observed measurement data and satisfies necessary constraints. Galerkin regression models also readily generalize to include higher-order nonlinear terms that model the effect of truncated modes. The effectiveness of such an approach is demonstrated on two canonical flow configurations: the two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder and the shear-driven cavity flow. For both cases, the accuracy of the identified models compare favourably against reduced-order models obtained from a standard Galerkin projection procedure. Finally, the entire code base for our constrained sparse Galerkin regression algorithm is freely available online.},

The innovation circumvents a disadvantage of standard model selection which typically limits the number of candidate models considered due to the intractability of computing information criteria. Using a recently developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of Akaike information criteria (AIC) or Bayes information criteria scores for the remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the time-series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each candidate model in the strong support, weak support or no support category. The method correctly recovers several canonical dynamical systems, including a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered disease model, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz equations, identifying the correct dynamical system as the only candidate model with strong support.},

We illustrate this using an experimental weakly turbulent fluid flow where only the velocity field is accessible. We also show that this hybrid approach allows reconstruction of the inaccessible variables -- the pressure and forcing field driving the flow.},

  abstract = {The determinants of growth rate and the associated metabolism has been at center stage in microbial physiology for over seventy years. In this paper we show that a cell sensing its own growth rate is in principle capable of maximising it using a gene regulatory circuit responsible for adapting metabolic enzyme concentrations in dynamic conditions. This is remarkable, since any state of (close-to) optimal growth depends on nutrient conditions, and is thus not a fixed target. We derive the properties of such gene regulatory networks, and prove that such circuits allow the growth rate to be a Lyapunov function. We derive this from a general stoichiometric and kinetic description of cellular metabolism. Interestingly, our finding is in agreement with our current understanding of how E. coli controls its growth rate. It uses ppGpp to tune the growth rate by balancing metabolic and ribosomal protein expression. Since ppGpp covaries 1-to-1 with the protein translation rate, an excellent proxy for growth rate, on a timescale of seconds, this suggests that direct sensing of the growth rate underlies growth rate optimisation in E. coli.},

Here we show how reaction--diffusion (RD) can be coupled to a molecular self-assembly process to generate macroscopic free-standing objects with control over shape, size, and functionality. In RD, two or more reactants diffuse from different positions to give rise to spatially defined structures on reaction. We demonstrate that RD can be used to locally control formation and self-assembly of hydrazone molecular gelators from their non-assembling precursors, leading to soft, free-standing hydrogel objects with sizes ranging from several hundred micrometres up to centimeters. Different chemical functionalities and gradients can easily be integrated in the hydrogel objects by using different reactants. Our methodology, together with the vast range of organic reactions and self-assembling building blocks, provides a general approach towards the programmed fabrication of soft microscale objects with controlled functionality and shape.},

Challenges remain in the development of biocompatible materials and the design of flexible implants for these purposes, where ulimate goals are for performance attributes approaching those of conventional wafer-based technologies and for operational timescales reaching the human lifespan. This Review summarizes recent advances in this field, with emphasis on active and passive constituent materials, design architectures and integration methods that support necessary levels of biocompatibility, electronic functionality, long-term stable operation in biofluids and reliability for use in vivo. Bioelectronic systems that enable multiplexed electrophysiological mapping across large areas at high spatiotemporal resolution are surveyed, with a particular focus on those with proven chronic stability in live animal models and scalability to thousands of channels over human-brain-scale dimensions. Research in materials science will continue to underpin progress in this field of study.},

For infants, children and adolescents, once implanted devices are outgrown, additional surgeries are often needed for device replacement, leading to repeated interventions and complications6--8. Here, we address this limitation with morphing electronics, which adapt to in vivo nerve tissue growth with minimal mechanical constraint. We design and fabricate multilayered morphing electronics, consisting of viscoplastic electrodes and a strain sensor that eliminate the stress at the interface between the electronics and growing tissue. The ability of morphing electronics to self-heal during implantation surgery allows a reconfigurable and seamless neural interface. During the fastest growth period in rats, morphing electronics caused minimal damage to the rat nerve, which grows 2.4-fold in diameter, and allowed chronic electrical stimulation and monitoring for 2 months without disruption of functional behavior. Morphing electronics offers a path toward growth-adaptive pediatric electronic medicine.},

We generate these patterns by implementing chemical reaction networks through synthetic DNA complexes, embedding the complexes in the hydrogel, and triggering with locally applied input DNA strands. We first demonstrate ring pattern formation around a circular input cavity and show that the ring width and intensity can be predictably tuned. Then, we create patterns of increasing complexity, including concentric rings and non-isotropic patterns. Finally, we show ``destructive'' and ``constructive'' interference patterns, by combining several ring-forming modules in the gel and triggering them from multiple sources. We further show that computer simulations based on the reaction--diffusion model can predict and inform the programming of target patterns.},

This property has well-established implications in statistical physics but remains underexplored in biological networks, especially for bacteria and other prokaryotes whose regulation of gene expression occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level. Focusing on the reconstructed regulatory network of Escherichia coli, we examine network responses to transient single-gene perturbations. We predict irreversibility in numerous cases and find that the incidence of irreversibility increases with the proximity of the perturbed gene to positive circuits in the network. Comparison with experimental data suggests a connection between the predicted irreversibility to transient perturbations and the evolutionary response to permanent perturbations.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive review of spatiotemporal pattern formation in systems driven away from equilibrium is presented, with emphasis on comparisons between theory and quantitative experiments. Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector {$q$}0 and frequency {$\omega$}0 of the instability. Type Is systems ({$\omega$}0=0, {$q$}0{$\neq$}0) are stationary in time and periodic in space; type IIIo systems ({$\omega$}0{$\neq$}0, {$q$}0=0) are periodic in time and uniform in space; and type Io systems ({$\omega$}0{$\neq$}0, {$q$}0{$\neq$}0) are periodic in both space and time. Near a continuous (or supercritical) instability, the dynamics may be accurately described via "amplitude equations," whose form is universal for each type of instability. The specifics of each system enter only through the nonuniversal coefficients. Far from the instability threshold a different universal description known as the "phase equation" may be derived, but it is restricted to slow distortions of an ideal pattern. For many systems appropriate starting equations are either not known or too complicated to analyze conveniently. It is thus useful to introduce phenomenological order-parameter models, which lead to the correct amplitude equations near threshold, and which may be solved analytically or numerically in the nonlinear regime away from the instability. The above theoretical methods are useful in analyzing "real pattern effects" such as the influence of external boundaries, or the formation and dynamics of defects in ideal structures. An important element in nonequilibrium systems is the appearance of deterministic chaos. A greal deal is known about systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying "temporal chaos," where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail. For spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, on the other hand, one is dealing with spatiotemporal chaos and appropriate methods of analysis need to be developed. In addition to the general features of nonequilibrium pattern formation discussed above, detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental work on many specific systems are presented. These include Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection in a pure fluid, convection in binary-fluid mixtures, electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals, Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders, parametric surface waves, patterns in certain open flow systems, oscillatory chemical reactions, static and dynamic patterns in biological media, crystallization fronts, and patterns in nonlinear optics. A concluding section summarizes what has and has not been accomplished, and attempts to assess the prospects for the future.},

That is, observed relaxation times are not simply proportional to the solvent viscosity as might be expected if the solvent were the only source of friction. However, a molecular interpretation of this remarkable phenomenon is currently lacking. Here, we use all-atom simulations of peptide and protein folding in explicit solvent, to probe the origin of the unusual viscosity dependence. We find that an important contribution to this effect, explaining the viscosity dependence of helix formation and the folding of a helix-containing protein, is the insensitivity of torsion angle isomerization to solvent friction. The influence of this landscape roughness can, in turn, be quantitatively explained by a rate theory including memory friction. This insensitivity of local barrier crossing to solvent friction is expected to contribute to the viscosity dependence of folding rates in larger proteins.},

As DMD methods work well in several situations but perform poorly in others, a clarification of the assumptions under which DMD is applicable is desirable. Upon closer inspection, existing interpretations of DMD methods based on the Koopman operator are not quite satisfactory: they justify DMD under assumptions that hold only with probability zero for generic observables. Here, we give a justification for DMD as a local, leading-order reduced model for the dominant system dynamics under conditions that hold with probability one for generic observables and non-degenerate observational data. We achieve this for autonomous and for periodically forced systems of finite or infinite dimensions by constructing linearizing transformations for their dominant dynamics within attracting slow spectral submanifolds (SSMs). Our arguments also lead to a new algorithm, data-driven linearization (DDL), which is a higher-order, systematic linearization of the observable dynamics within slow SSMs. We show by examples how DDL outperforms DMD and EDMD on numerical and experimental data.},

In this work, we theoretically compare the precision of phase estimations achievable with classical phase microscopy techniques, operated at the shot-noise limit. We show how the Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound is calculated for any linear optical system, including phase-contrast microscopy, phase-shifting holography, spatial light interference microscopy, and local optimization of wavefronts for phase imaging. Through these examples, we demonstrate how this general framework can be applied for the design and optimization of classical phase microscopes. Our results show that wavefront shaping is required to design phase microscopes with optimal phase precision.},

The precision of such measurement depends on the number of detected photons but also on the various sources of noise arising from the measurement process. Using Fisher information theory, we calculate the lower bound on the precision of lifetime estimations for mono-exponential and bi-exponential distributions. We analyse the dependence of the lifetime estimation precision on experimentally relevant parameters, including the contribution of a non-uniform background noise and the instrument response function (IRF) of the setup. We also provide an open-source code to determine the lower bound on the estimation precision for any experimental conditions. Two practical examples illustrate how this tool can be used to reach optimal precision in time-resolved fluorescence microscopy.},

In the present analysis, we show that quantum thermometers that are described by nonlinear Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equations allow for a significantly enhanced precision, that means larger quantum Fisher information. This is demonstrated for a variety of pedagogical scenarios consisting of single and two-qubits systems. The enhancement in precision is indicated by non-vanishing quantum speed limits, which originate in the fact that the thermal, Gibbs state is typically not invariant under the nonlinear equations of motion.},

We present nanomechanical resonators that extend centimeters in length yet retain nanometer thickness. We explore this expanded design space using an optimization approach which judiciously employs fast millimeter-scale simulations to steer the more computationally intensive centimeter-scale design optimization. By employing delicate nanofabrication techniques, our approach ensures high-yield realization, experimentally confirming room-temperature quality factors close to theoretical predictions. The synergy between nanofabrication, design optimization guided by machine learning, and precision engineering opens a solid-state path to room-temperature quality factors approaching 10 billion at kilohertz mechanical frequencies -- comparable to the performance of leading cryogenic resonators and levitated nanospheres, even under significantly less stringent temperature and vacuum conditions.},

The authors give an overview of results in areas of current research interest, such as Bayesian quantum estimation, noisy quantum metrology, and distributed quantum sensing. The authors address the question of how minimum measurement errors can be achieved using entanglement as well as more general quantum states. This review is presented from a geometric perspective.

Allowing for the finite lifetime of the catalyst (B{$\rightarrow$}inert products) adds another dimension. The dependence of the stationary-states on residence-time now yields isolas or mushrooms. Sustained oscillations (stable limit cycles) are also possible. The onset of oscillation corresponds to a change in the character of the stationary-state (from stable focus to unstable focus) and the conditions for this change can be evaluated analytically. The period of the oscillations and their amplitudes increase as the residence time is lengthened. A total of nine different phase-portraits in the a--b plane has been found. The isothermal system is less complex than the exothermic, first-order reaction in a CSTR, but there are strong analogies between the two.},

The entropy change is given as the sum of the entropy production and the divergence of entropy flow. The divergence of entropy is calculated based on the chemical potential of steady state. It becomes evident that: (i) the entropy change for the emergence of dissipative structures in the open system can be positive or negative, (ii) most of the entropy produced inside the system is thrown out to the environment when dissipative structures are developing, (iii) the entropy production and the divergence of entropy flow balance completely, when the system shows static steady states, (iv) the entropy change behaves as if it is the time derivative of the entropy production. Prior to these calculations of entropy balance, the features of emergent patterns in the two-dimensional system are examined in terms of entropy production solely. The results imply that the entropy production can be an index for us to discriminate spatial patterns, but is not a global thermodynamic potential for the evolution of dissipative structures.},

  abstract = {Quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) is a cornerstone of modern quantum metrology and quantum information geometry. Apart from optimal estimation, it finds applications in description of quantum speed limits, quantum criticality, quantum phase transitions, coherence, entanglement, and irreversibility. We derive a surprisingly simple formula for this quantity, which, unlike previously known general expression, does not require diagonalization of the density matrix, and is provably at least as efficient. With a minor modification, this formula can be used to compute QFIM for any finite-dimensional density matrix. Because of its simplicity, it could also shed more light on the quantum information geometry in general.},

The roles of EQCM in describing electrode/electrolyte interface dynamics, such as the electric double-layer build-up, ionic/molecular adsorption, metal nucleation, and growth, are addressed. Modeling of the QCM sensor is introduced and its importance is emphasized. Challenges of metal electrode use, including side reactions and dendrite formation, along with their mitigation strategies are reviewed. Numerous factors affecting the electroplating processes, such as electrolyte composition, additives, temperature, and current density, and their influence on the electroplated metals' mass, structural, and mechanical characteristics are discussed. Looking forward, the need for deeper fundamental understanding and advancing simulations of the QCM signal response as a result of electroplating metal nanostructures is stressed. Further development and integration of innovative EQCM-strategies will provide unique future means to fundamentally understand and optimize metal electroplating for energy storage and application alike.},

The output QCM-D characteristics consist of the resonance frequency (MHz frequency range) and resonance bandwidth measured with extra-ordinary precision of a few tenths of Hz. Depending on the electrodes stiffness/softness, QCM-D operates either as a gravimetric or complex mechanical probe of their intrinsic structure. For at least 20 years, QCM-D has been successfully used in biochemical and environmental science and technology for its ability to probe the structure of soft solvated interfaces.Practical battery and supercapacitor electrodes appear frequently as porous solids with their stiffness changing due to interactions with electrolyte solutions or as a result of ion intercalation/adsorption and long-term electrode cycling.Unfortunately, most QCM measurements with electrochemical systems are carried out based on a single (fundamental) frequency and, as such, provided that the resonance bandwidth remains constant, are suitable for only gravimetric sensing. The multiharmonic measurements have been carried out mainly on conducting/redox polymer films rather than on typical composite battery/supercapacitor electrodes.Here, we summarize the most recent publications devoted to the development of electrochemical QCM-D (EQCM-D)-based methodology for systematic characterization of mechanical properties of operating battery/supercapacitor electrodes. By varying the electrodes' composition and structure (thin/thick layers, small/large particles, binders with different mechanical properties, etc.), nature of the electrolyte solutions and charging/cycling conditions, the method is shown to be operated in different application modes. A variety of useful electrode-material properties are assessed noninvasively, in situ, and in real time frames of ion intercalation into the electrodes of interest.A detailed algorithm for the mechanical characterization of battery electrodes kept in the gas phase and immersed into the electrolyte solutions has been developed for fast recognition of stiff and viscoelastic materials in terms of EQCM-D signatures treated by the hydrodynamic and viscoelastic models. Working examples of the use of in situ hydrodynamic spectroscopy to characterize stiff rough/porous solids of complex geometry and viscoelastic characterization of soft electrodes are presented. The most demonstrative example relates to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase on Li4Ti5O12 electrodes in the presence of different electrolyte solutions and additives: only a few cycles (an experiment during {$\sim$}30 min) were required for screening the electrolyte systems for their ability to form high-quality surface films in experimental EQCM-D cells as compared to 100 cycles (200 h cycling) in conventional coin cells. Thin/small-mass electrodes required for the EQCM-D analysis enable accelerated cycling tests for ultrafast mechanical characterization of these electrodes in different electrolyte solutions. Hence, this methodology can be easily implemented as a highly effective in situ analytical tool in the field of energy storage and conversion.}

A special focus of this review is on the fundamental aspects of acoustic probing of electrode films rigidly attached to the surface of a quartz crystal sensor oscillating in thickness shear mode on multiple overtone orders. It is shown that the concept of acoustic load impedance and the related complex frequency change is of key importance to collect and quantitatively analyze diverse information on in situ acoustic properties of real energy storage electrodes. We provide a comprehensive description of the principles of hydrodynamic modeling of acoustic load impedance related to stiff electrodes with complex geometry/morphology (e.g. rough and porous structures), and viscoelastic modeling of the load impedance of the softer electrodes. These models are fitted to the experimental complex frequency changes (i.e. resonance frequency and resonance width changes) such that the fitted parameters present a complete set of gravimetric, electrochemical and mechanical characteristics of the operated electrodes. A practical application of the concept of acoustic load impedance enables to provide the viable solutions to the various problems of electrodes used in energy storage devices. This is demonstrated herein taking as a typical example a new 2D layered material Ti3C2 (MXene). A short section of the review is devoted to details of electrode coatings fabrication which allows the operation of the EQCM-D as a universal gravimetric, hydrodynamic and viscoelastic probe of the electrodes state of health under different conditions of charging, cycling and aging.},

This article illustrates some key advances in the development of a special variation of this technique called quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The main feature and advantage of QCM-D, compared with the conventional QCM, is that it in addition to measuring changes in resonant frequency ({$\Delta$}f), a simultaneous parameter related to the energy loss or dissipation ({$\Delta$}D) of the system is also measured. {$\Delta$}f essentially measures changes in the mass attached to the sensor surface, while {$\Delta$}D measures properties related to the viscoelastic properties of the adlayer. Thus, QCM-D measures two totally independent properties of the adlayer. The focus of this review is an overview of the QCM-D technology and highlights of recent applications. Specifically, recent applications dealing with DNA, proteins, lipids, and cells will be detailed. This is not intended as a comprehensive review of all possible applications of the QCM-D technology, but rather a glimpse into a few highlighted application areas in the biomolecular field that were published in 2007.},

  abstract = {Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) is a powerful tool for studying adhesion, yet its use for analyzing the deposition of microparticles and living cells on surfaces has been hampered by difficulties in interpretation. Here we report a new quantitative model of QCM-D response, presented as an equivalent acoustic impedance circuit. As an essential feature, the particle interaction with surrounding fluid is modeled by relations for a freely oscillating rotating and translating sphere in an unbounded fluid, which is a valid approximation for microparticles. This helps deduce from the measured reponse the parameters pertinent to the contact mechanics. We use the model to analyze deposition of different microparticles as well as Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria on several substrates using QCM-D combined with real-time microscopy. The parameter space is increased by varying particle type and size, substrate surface chemistry and rigidity, and ionic strength of the solution, which allows observation of diverse responses and transition from inertial to elastic loading, including rarely observed resonant regimes. Ultimately, we find that the model describes reasonably well the observed response for different microparticles and substrates, as well as for bacteria, and enables extraction of the contact characteristics in elastic and mixed loading regimes. It also reveals discrepancies between measured and anticipated parameters for large particles. The new model can be a useful tool for interpreting and quantifying QCM-D data on the adhesion of particles and living cells to surfaces, including time-dependent adhesion phenomena.}

However, analysis of the QCM-D output to quantitatively analyze adhesion of (bio)colloids to obtain viscoelastic bond properties is still a subject of debate. Here, we analyze the QCM-D output to analyze the bond between two hydrophilic streptococcal strains 91 nm long and without fibrillar surface appendages and micron-sized hydrophobic polystyrene particles on QCM-D crystal surfaces with different hydrophobicities, using the Kelvin--Voigt model and the Maxwell model. A Poisson distribution was implemented in order to determine the possible virtues of including polydispersity when fitting model parameters to the data. The quality of the fits did not indicate whether the Kelvin--Voigt or the Maxwell model is preferable and only polydispersity in spring-constants improved the fit for polystyrene particles. The Kelvin--Voigt and Maxwell models both yielded higher spring-constants for the bald streptococcus than for the fibrillated one. In both models, the drag coefficients increased for the bald streptococcus with the ratio of electron-donating over electron-accepting parameters of the crystal surface, while for the fibrillated strain the drag coefficient was similar on all crystal surfaces. Combined with the propensity of fibrillated streptococci to bind to the sensor crystal as a coupled-resonator above the crystal surface, this suggests that the drag experienced by resonator-coupled, hydrophilic particles is more influenced by the viscosity of the bulk water than by interfacial water adjacent to the crystal surface. Hydrophilic particles that lack a surface tether are mass-coupled just above the crystal surface and accordingly probe the drag due to the thin layer of interfacial water that is differently structured on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Hydrophobic particles without a surface tether are also mass-coupled, but their drag coefficient decreases when the ratio of electron-donating over electron-accepting parameters increases, suggesting that hydrophobic particles experience less drag due to the structured water adjacent to the surface.},

  abstract = {The study of protein adsorption on the membrane surface is of great importance to cheese-making processors that use polymeric membrane-based processes to recover whey protein from the process waste streams. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) is a lab-scale, fast analytical technique that can precisely monitor and quantify the amount of proteins adsorbed onto the polymer surface in real time. The ability of the software that accompanies the instrument to predict the minute amount of the mass of the protein on the surface and the structural properties of the adsorbed protein requires a suitable viscoelastic model to convert the data of frequency and dissipation shift responses generated from the QCM-D apparatus into the mass and viscoelastic properties of the proteins adsorbed on the surface at given times. In this study, data recorded by a QCM-D apparatus were fitted into the Kevin---Voigt model, to quantify the whey protein adsorption on the polyethersulfone membrane surface.},

  abstract = {The longstanding question of how stochastic behaviour arises from deterministic Hamiltonian dynamics is of great importance, and any truly holistic theory must be capable of describing this transition. In this review, we introduce the influence functional formalism in both the quantum and classical regimes. Using this technique, we demonstrate how irreversible behaviour arises generically from the reduced microscopic dynamics of a system-environment amalgam. The influence functional is then used to rigorously derive stochastic equations of motion from a microscopic Hamiltonian. In this method stochastic terms are not identified heuristically, but instead arise from an exact mapping only available in the path-integral formalism. The interpretability of the individual stochastic trajectories arising from the mapping is also discussed. As a consequence of these results, we are also able to show that the proper classical limit of stochastic quantum dynamics corresponds non-trivially to a generalised Langevin equation derived with the classical influence functional. This provides a further unifying link between open quantum systems and their classical equivalent, highlighting the utility of influence functionals and their potential as a tool in both fundamental and applied research.},

The proposed algorithm is a quantum version of a dynamic mode decomposition algorithm used in diverse fields such as fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and epidemiology. Our quantum algorithm can also compute matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors by analyzing the corresponding linear dynamical system. Our algorithm handles a broad range of matrices, particularly those with complex eigenvalues. The complexity of our quantum algorithm is {$O$}⁡(polylog⁡{$N$}) for an {$N$}-dimensional system. This is an exponential speedup over known classical algorithms with at least {$O$}⁡({$N$}) complexity. Thus, our quantum algorithm is expected to enable high-dimensional dynamical systems analysis and large matrix eigenvalue decomposition, intractable for classical computers.},

  abstract = {In the last years, ensemble methods have been widely popular in atmospheric, climate, and ocean dynamics investigations and forecasts as convenient methods to obtain statistical information on these systems. In many cases, ensembles have been used as an approximation to the probability distribution that has acquired more and more a central role, as the importance of a single trajectory, or member, was recognized as less informative. This paper shows that using results from the dynamical systems and more recent results from the machine learning and AI communities, we can arrive at a direct estimation of the probability distribution evolution and also at the formulation of predictor systems based on a nonlinear formulation. The paper introduces the theory and demonstrates its application to two examples. The first is a one-dimensional system based on the Ni{\~n}o-3 index; the second is a multidimensional case based on time series of monthly mean SST in the Pacific. We show that we can construct the probability distribution and set up a system to forecast its evolution and derive various quantities from it. The objective of the paper is not strict realism, but the introduction of these methods and the demonstration that they can be used also in the complex, multidimensional environment typical of atmosphere and ocean applications.},
