Dr. Swetamber Das joined the group in April 2020 as a postdoctoral associate after spending two years as a visiting scientist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems (MPI-PKS) Dresden (Germany). He obtained his PhD in 2018 from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai (India) under Prof. Neelima M. Gupte. His PhD work was on impurity dynamics, transport, and synchronization in nonlinear discrete-time systems.  He then joined MPI-PKS to explore the origins of partial barriers to transport in volume-preserving systems, with Prof. Arnd BÃ¤cker. At MPI-PKS, he also developed an interest in biophysics and investigated a kinetic model of a gene regulatory motif exhibiting the influence of protein resource sharing.  His interests and expertise are in the field of nonlinear dynamics and chaos and his current research involves classical speed limits on the response of dynamical systems.
