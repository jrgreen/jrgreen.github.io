**We currently have an opening for a Ph.D. student.**

If you would like information about the Department of Chemistry or Physics, please email either Professor Green directly. 

To be added to our mailing list, please sign up here.

### Why join the group?

- Three undergraduates in the group have published papers and gone on to the highest-ranking graduate schools (Caltech, Northwestern, University of California Irvine) and industry.

- Four group members are now faculty at other universities.

- UMB is on the oceanfront campus, minutes from downtown Boston. Campus offers many nice views of downtown and the <a href="https://www.bostonharborislands.org/">harbor islands</a>.

- The group is housed in the <a href="https://www.umb.edu/campus-planning/projects/integrated-sciences-complex/">Integrated Science Complex</a>, just off the <a href="https://www.umb.edu/campus-planning/projects/harborwalk/">Harborwalk</a>.

- Take a virtual tour? UMB was featured in "The College Tour":

_Position filled 1 September 2024. Please check back here or reach out for other opportunities._

### Postdoctoral Researcher Openings
<br>

<small>As a part of NSF funded projects, our group at the University of Massachusetts Boston has an opening for a highly-motivated and cross-disciplinary postdoctoral researcher interested in statistical mechanics and machine learning.</small>

<small>The position is open to recent Ph.D.s with a demonstrated ability to conduct high-impact research. The successful candidate will join a cutting-edge theoretical research project, collaborating with the PI and other group members to develop statistical mechanics, machine learning, and nonlinear dynamics to understand nonequilibrium processes. The group’s research is interdisciplinary, focusing on complex chemical and physical systems and their dynamics away from equilibrium. For example, the group has been actively working on thermodynamic speed limits (e.g., Nicholson, García-Pintos, del Campo, Green _Nat. Phys._ **2020** 16(12), p. 1211-1215; Das, Green _Phys. Rev. Research_ **2023** 5 L012016; Das, Green _Phys. Rev. E_ **2024** in press <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.12047">arXiv:2305.12047</a>). Familiarity with speed limits or complementary theory would be a plus.</small>

<small>**Qualifications:** Candidates will work on NSF-funded projects at the intersection of machine learning and statistical mechanics. The position is open to recent PhDs with a demonstrated ability to conduct high-impact research.</small>

<small>**Location:** The group is located at the University of Massachusetts, right on Boston Harbor and minutes from downtown Boston. For more information, please explore our website.</small>

<small>**To apply:** Interested candidates should e-mail an application to Professor Green (jason.green@umb.edu) including a curriculum vitae and the names/contact information of two potential recommendations.</small>

<small>Candidates selected for further consideration will be asked to send letters of recommendation. Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the positions are filled.</small>
