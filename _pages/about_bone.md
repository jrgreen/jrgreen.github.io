<b>Rebecca Bone, Ph.D. Chemistry 2022</b><br>
<em>Now Postdoctoral Research Associate at NIST/Theiss Research</em><br>
Rebecca began as a graduate student in the Chemistry Ph.D. program in September 2017 after graduating with a Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry from Iona College (magna cum laude). At Iona, she worked under Dr. Mychel Varner in the electronic modeling of the atmospheric reactions of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiacloprid. In the summer of 2016, she worked under Dr. Paul Maggard in the development of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells at North Carolina State University at the Research Experience for Undergraduates site ‘Exploring the Interface between Experiments and Computation’ from the NSF. Her Ph.D. research involved the development of methods and tools to characterize complex systems by leveraging time-dependent probabilities of stochastic paths.
