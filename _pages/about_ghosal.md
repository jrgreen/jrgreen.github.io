<b>Aishani Ghosal, Postdoctoral Research Associate</b><br>
Dr. Aishani Ghosal joined the group in January 2023 as a postdoctoral research associate and has been working on speed limits in stochastic thermodynamics. From 2020 to 2022, she worked on stochastic thermodynamics of partially observed systems in the group of Dr. Gili Bisker at Tel Aviv University, Israel. Before that she was a visiting scientist at S N Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Kolkata (India), after finishing my Integrated Ph.D. degree in 2019 on theoretical studies of the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of colloidal and polymeric systems at the single molecule level at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (India) under the supervision of Prof. Binny J. Cherayil.
