<b>Sky Nicholson, Research Assistant Professor</b><br>
<em>Now Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University</em>
Dr. Schuyler Nicholson was a Research Assistant Professor in the group. He graduated from Clarkson University in Potsdam NY with a B.S. in Physics in 2008 and an M.S. in Physics in 2010. He then began his doctoral work at the University of Sheffield in the UK under Dr. Eun-jin Kim. At Sheffield, he worked on developing tools in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and extending geometric representations of complex systems. Upon successfully defending his Ph.D. in 2015, Schuyler began his postdoctoral work using information theory to tackle a range of questions in complex chemistry and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.
