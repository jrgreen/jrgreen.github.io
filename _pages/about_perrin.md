<b>Louis Perrin, Visiting MS student</b><br>
Louis was a visiting graduate student from the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de Rennes (mechatronics department) who worked with Tamiki Komatsuzaki in the Research Institute of Electronic Sciences at Hokkaido university during 2021 (remotely due to COVID-19). His research currently focuses on molecular dynamics and information theory. More specifically, his work is about inferring the interaction potential energy of particles based on a set of trajectories with information-theoretic tools.
