Our research uses theory, computation, and data to understand how to design synthetic material systems that perform useful dynamical functions.
These functions include the assembly and replication of multiscale structures, the capture and conversion of energy, the regulation of chemical reaction networks for keeping time, and the generation of power.
To address this challenge, we are develop theory at the intersection of statistical mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, and data science.
Our goal is to guide experiments and produce energy-efficient materials that harness flows of matter and energy to execute dynamical functions on finely tuned timescales.

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
