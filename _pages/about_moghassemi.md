<b>Sepideh Ein Moghassemi, Ph.D. student (Chemistry)</b><br>
Sepideh began as a graduate student in the Physical Chemistry Ph.D. program in September 2022. She graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in Physical Chemistry from the Iran University of science and technology. At IUST, she worked under Dr. Majid Hashemianzadeh and Dr. Sajad Ghareghani in the Application of regression methods, dynamic simulation, and classification methods for estimating solubility and predicting the partition coefficient of 200 medicines. During her master's degree, she also collaborated on a project using the ANI-1 neural network to predict the potential energy surface of some medicines. Her Ph.D. research involves the application of machine learning techniques to optimize, and predict dynamic behaviors, and developing these techniques for the function of materials.
