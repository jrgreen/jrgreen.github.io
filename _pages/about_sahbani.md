<b>Mohamed Sahbani, Ph.D. Candidate and Oracle Doctoral Research Fellow (Physics)</b><br>
Mohamed joined the group in September 2021 as a Ph.D. student in Physics. His current research focuses on a classical density matrix theory. Within that theory, he is constructing a Fisher information in the tangent space of deterministic systems that is analogous to the quantum Fisher information and applying it to low-dimensional regular and chaotic dynamical systems.
