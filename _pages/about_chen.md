<b>Shiqi Chen, Postdoctoral Research Associate</b><br>
Dr. Shiqi Chen joined the group in October 2024 as a postdoctoral research associate and has been working on Koopman eigenvalues and entropy production rates in stochastic non-equilibrium thermodynamics. He obtained his chemistry PhD at the University of Chicago in June 2024. From 2018 to 2024, he worked with Prof. Norbert F. Scherer and Prof. Andrew L. Ferguson on the development and application of data-driven methods to study non-equilibrium steady states in optical matter systems. Before that he completed his undergraduate studies in Peking University in Beijing, China.
