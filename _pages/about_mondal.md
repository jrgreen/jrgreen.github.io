<b>Shrabani Mondal, Former Postdoctoral Research Associate</b><br>
<em>Now Assistant Professor at Jadavpur University</em><br>
Dr. Shrabani Mondal joined the group as a Postdoctoral Research Associate after receiving her doctoral degree from Visva-Bharati University India, supported by CSIR Junior and Senior research fellowships. At Visva-Bharati, she worked under Dr. Bidhan Chandra Bag in the area of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. She was involved in exploring aspects of Brownian motion in barrier crossing dynamics, dynamics of complex systems (aggregation kinetics and cluster formation), stochastic resonance, ambient energy harvesting, and the microscopic theory of heat transfer. Her current research involves the development of theory for dynamic matter using statistical mechanics and information theory.
